            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In Anſwer to this, I ſhall return you the words of one of your approved General Councils, the fourth at <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, as <hi>Binius</hi> and others of your own record it, where in the firſt Chapter they ſet down their Catholick Faith, two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107126:7"/>Articles of which are, 1. That no man can be ſaved out of their univerſal Church. And 2. That the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament of the Altar are tranſubſtantiate into the body and blood of Chriſt, the appearances remaining. And in the third Chapter, they ſay We Excommunicate and Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe every Hereſie extolling it ſelf againſt this holy Orthodox Catholick Faith, which we have before exponed, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Hereticks, by what names ſoever they be called. And being condemned, let them be left to the preſent ſecular powers, or their Bayliffs, to be puniſhed, the Clergy being firſt degraded of their orders, and let the goods of ſuch condemned ones be confiſcate, if they be Lay-men; but if they be Clergy-men, let them be given to the Churches whence they had their Stipends. And thoſe that are found notable only by ſuſpition, if they do not by congruous purgation demonſtrate their innocency; according to the conſiderations of the ſuſpition, and the quality of the perſon, let them be ſmitten with the ſword of <hi>Anathema,</hi> and avoided by all men, till they have given ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſatisfaction; and if they remain a year excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, let them then be condemned as Hereticks. And let the ſecular powers, in what office ſoever, be admoniſhed, and perſwaded, and, if neceſſary, compelled by Eccleſiaſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that as they would be reputed and accounted believers, ſo for the defence of the faith, they take an Oath publikely, that they will ſtudy in good earneſt, according to their power, to exterminate all that are by the Church denoted Hereticks from the Countries ſubject to their Juriſdiction. So that when any one ſhall be taken into Spiritual, or Temporal power, he ſhall by his Oath make good this Chapter. But if the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lord being required or admoniſhed by the Church, ſhall neglect to purge his Countrey of Heretical defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let him by the Metropolitan and Comprovincial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops be tyed by the bond of Excommunication. And if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſatisfie within a year, let it be ſignified to the Pope, that he from thenceforth may denounce his Vaſſals abſolved from his fidelity, and may expoſe his Countrey to be Seiſed on by Catholiques, who rooting out the Hereticks, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it without contradiction, and may keep it in the purity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107126:8"/>of faith; ſaving the right of the principal Lord, ſo be it that he make no hinderance hereabout, and oppoſe not any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment: and the ſame Law is to be obſerved with them that are not principal Lords. And the Catholikes that taking the ſign of the Croſs ſhall ſet themſelves to the rooting out of the Hereticks, ſhall enjoy the ſame Indulgences and holy priviledges, which were granted to thoſe that go to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Holy Land. Moreover we decree that the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Receivers, Defenders, and favourers of Hereticks, ſhall be excommunicate, firmly decreeing, that after any ſuch is noted by excommunication, if he refuſe to ſatisfie within a year, he ſhall from thenceforth be <hi>ipſo Jure</hi> infamous, and may not be admitted into publick offices, or councils, or to the choice of ſuch, nor to bear witneſs. And he ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate, and not have power to make a Will, nor come to ſucceſſion of inheritance. And no man ſhall be forced to anſwer him in any cauſe, but he ſhall be forced to anſwer others. And if he be a Judge, his ſentence ſhall be invalid, and no cauſes ſhall be brought unto his hearing. If he be an advocate, his Plea ſhall not be admitted. If a Notary (or Regiſter) the Inſtruments made by him ſhall be utterly void, and damned, with the damned Author. And ſo in other the like caſes we command that it be obſerved: Thus the Council. The Summ of which is, that all the Pope calls Hereticks, muſt be condemned and deſtroyed, That all Kings, Princes, or Lords that will not execute his ſentence, and root them out; muſt be diſpoſſeſſed of their Dominions, and the ſubjects abſolved from fidelity, (whatever Oaths they had taken) and all others that do but favour or receive them, be utterly undone, and exterminated. Now ſeeing our Author tells us that the determination of a general Council is infallible truth, and we have this with the <hi>decernimus &amp; firmiter ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus</hi> of a general Council, this muſt be acknowledged to be ſo. Indeed I confeſs that ſome Romaniſts do affirm that this is not the genuine Decree of the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> but only of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> foiſted in amongſt the genuine Decrees;

<label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Cap. 4. ſ. 1.</note> but whereas he would make him moreover to aſſert,
<q>That this Authority was never acknowledged in the Church till the time of <hi>Boniface;</hi> And further, that we have not ſeparated from any Authority, if any were exerciſed by the former Popes, during the times of the four firſt General Councils, he deals diſingenuouſly with the Doctor,</q> in whom no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of this aſſertion can be found, albeit it be a great and evident truth. But whereas he would make him further to affirm of the whole heap of <hi>Roman</hi> Novelties, <hi>That there was no mention of them in the time of the four firſt General Councils,</hi> he doth more groſly and palpably abuſe him, only that he might make room for thoſe Citations, which otherwiſe would have been evidently impertinent, and might ſeem to fight againſt the Doctors Sermon, when he is only beating that man of clouts, which himſelf hath made. Nay Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> evidently acknowledgeth, that ſome of their Hereſies may be derived from <hi>Origen, Tertullian,</hi> &amp;c. So, that our Author (which is a bad omen) ſtumbles at the threſhold, builds his whole Fabrick on a miſtake, and confutes only what himſelf hath fancied, not what the Doctor hath aſſerted. Well
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107126:14"/>then, that which he hath to do, if he would contradict his aſſertion, is, to ſhew, not whither the Popes praeceding chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged a ſupremacy of juriſdiction, but whither the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop was acknowledged of the Church of God, as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal head; as one who had received from the beginning, a power of juriſdiction over the Univerſal Church. Now in returning an anſwer to what is delivered for the proof of this, we ſhall conſider, firſt, his reaſons; ſecondly, his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; thirdly, his returns to what the Dr. brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this Supremacy.</p>
               <p>Well then to make it appear reaſonable,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> he tells us, <hi>That ſince General Councils (the only abſolute ſupream Authority Eccleſiaſtical) either for want of agreement among Princes,
<note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> or by the inconvenience of the long abſence of Prelates, or their great expences,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>can very ſeldom be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, it would be impoſſible without an ordinary conſtant ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupream Authority to prevent Schiſm, that is, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Church ſhould ſubſiſt.</hi> This Argument reduced into Syllogiſmes ſounds thus: That without which the Church cannot ſubſiſt, ought in all reaſon to be granted; But, Without the ſupream juriſdiction of the Pope, the Church cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The major we paſs as evident by its own light; The minor is thus proved; That without which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prevent Schiſms, is that without which tis impoſſible the Church ſhould ſubſiſt; but this ſupream juriſdiction of the Pope, is that without which tis impoſſible to prevent Schiſms. To give a ſatisfactory Anſwer to this, it will be neceſſary to premiſe, that Schiſm is a rupture of one part from another, and that of the viſible Church, as appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tis a crime puniſhable by the Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrate, which it could not be, if it were a ſeceſſion from the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church only, 2. This Schiſm may be either of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church from another, or of one member of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church from the ſame Church; and I hope our Author will not ſay that to the redreſſing of this Schiſm, The Supream Authority of the Pope is neceſſary, ſeeing he muſt neceſſarily permit this to theſe Rulers, which he imagins inferiour to him, and therefore muſt acknowledge them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to redreſs the ſaid miſcarriages. 3. The Schiſm of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107126:14"/>one particular Church from another, may be either in things neceſſary to ſalvation, or in things not neceſſary, but of lighter moment. Now then to anſwer to his Major, if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it of Schiſms of the former nature, tis true; for errors in things neceſſary to ſalvation deſtroy the very being of a Church: In this ſence therefore we grant the Major, but deny the Minor; If he underſtand it in the latter ſence, we deny the Major, as holding that not every breach upon ſuch ſlight accounts, or circumſtantial buſineſſes, doth diſſolve the viſible Church, but it may ſubſiſt with ſuch a breach, if ſo be the eſſentials and vitals of Religion be ſtill preſerved, and the Sacraments truly adminiſtred; For if the Church of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at <hi>Corinth,</hi> when there were diviſions, Sects, emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contentions, quarrels, and the practice of ſuch things which were execrable to the very Heathens, and of ſuch whereof the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, We have no ſuch cuſtom, who dares deny them to be the Churches of God, who differ from others only in circumſtantials? What would ſuch men have ſaid to the Galatians, who ſo far adulterated the Goſpel of Chriſt (purely kept and preſerved in other Churches) that the Apoſtle pronounceth concerning them, that they were bewitched; and if they ſtill perſiſted to joyn Circumciſion and the Law together with Chriſt, they were faln from Grace, Chriſt would profit them nothing, whom yet the Apoſtle acknowledgeth to be the Church of God, writing to the Church which is in <hi>Galatia.</hi> Secondly, Suppoſe a Supream juriſdiction were neceſſary to the preventing Schiſms, muſt it needs be the Supremacy of the Pope? why may it not as well be the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> or one elected by the ſuffrages of particular Churches? 3. We deny, that the Authority of the Pope is neceſſary to this end, even to the ſuppreſſion of leſſer Schiſms, yea or expedient; for were it ſo, then either of Schiſms ariſing from breach of charity, or difference of judgement; Not the firſt; for tis not poſſible for the Pope, to inſuſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into any party, or to uſe other means to effect it then rational motives from Scripture, which any other man may do: If it be expedient for difference of judgement, ſeeing the Schiſms that ariſe from that difference concern himſelf, it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107126:15"/>would then, 1. Be expedient, that he ſhould be judge in his own cauſe; as for inſtance, Tis doubted whither the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath any Authority delegated to him from Chriſt over the Univerſal Church; whither tis expedient, ſuch an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be admitted; whither the Authority of a Pope ſhould tranſcend that of a General Council; whither the Religion the preſent Pope ſubſcribes to, and publickly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, be true; whither the contrary which he perſecutes, be falſe; whither he be infallible, in his ſentence and Cathedra; and whither the interpretation of <hi>Tues Petrus,</hi> and <hi>Paſce Oves,</hi> be to be ſought from his mouth or no. Is it expedient, will the Church of <hi>France</hi> ſay, that he ſhould judge in <hi>all theſe</hi> Cauſes? the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>in any?</hi> and doth not reaſon ſay ſo to? and what madneſs were it for each to hold ſo ſtifly the contrary, if we could perſwade our ſelves, that it were thus? or if this were ſo neceſſary, that without the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of ſuch a power and ſubmiſſion to it, it were impoſſible to prevent Schiſms, and the deſtruction of the Church thereby; is it not wonderful, that in the whole Scripture there ſhould not be any thing directing us to go to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to have theſe Schiſms, which are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Church, prevented? That the Apoſtle among all his charges to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to break off their Schiſms, all the means to prevent it, ſhould neglect that without which it was not feaſible? that ſpeaking of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Doctrines that ſhould ſpring up in the latter time, we ſhould have no Items where the truth was to be kept inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and whither to have recourſe to avoid them? If a Jeſuit had been at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> elbow, when after the rehearſal of thoſe Doctrines he ſaith to <hi>Timothy, If thou put the Brethren in mind of theſe things,</hi> &amp;c. he would have added [and ſendeſt them to the Pope for Preſervatives againſt them] <hi>thou ſhalt then be a good Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> otherwiſe no Miniſter at all, but an Heretick. And when he tells them, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Teachers ſhould ariſe, and commends them thereupon to the Word of God, a Jeſuit would have told him that this was the way to make them Hereticks, nothing more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious, and that he ſhould commend them to the Pope. Yea (3.) That the Scripture ſhould exhort us on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107126:15"/>to run to the Law and to the Teſtimonies, and tell us that if they ſpeak not agreeable thereto, there is no truth in them, when we ought not to meddle with them, eſpecially ſo, as to judge with the judgement of diſcretion, what's Truth and Errour, that the Apoſtle ſhould bid us try the ſpirits, <hi>Yea try all things, and hold faſt the Truth,</hi> and that directing us to no other touchſtone then Scripture, and reaſon; that ſure word by which we are to take heed, is not agreeable to theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; for ſhould it be that we may try no other truth, yet aſſuredly we muſt try whether the Pope hath the ſupream authority or no, and ſo be Judges of our Judge, which ſure is dangerous. Yea (4) Is it not wonderful, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> amidſt all the bands of Unity ſo carefully reckoned up, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. <hi>One Body, one Spirit, one Hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God,</hi> ſhould forget, one Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſpiritual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, without whoſe Soverain power, if our Author may be believed, the Church of God cannot ſubſiſt? Sure if there had been any ſuch thing, this had been a proper place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to mention it. No, had the Apoſtle thought of the delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, it would not have been to the Law, and to the Teſtimonies; but to the Popes, Council and his Cardinals? (4.) To multiply no more, the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Schiſms of the latter ſort is not neceſſary to the ſubſiſtence of the Church <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> but to its ſubſiſtence in <hi>ſtatu meliori.</hi> Now thence to infer, that God hath provided an Head to govern the Univerſal Church, is as Illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, as if becauſe the Church Militant would be in a better Condition, were its members impeccable, to infer that God hath provided ſome external means to effect it: Or becauſe the making them all of one mind, or enlightning them with the truth, would prevent Schiſm and Hereſie, therefore God ſhould do ſo, or provide other means beſide his word to bring it to paſs; To infer, that thence the members of the Church ſhould ſpontaneouſly ſubmit to one ſuch ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons judgement, ſo as to have their Conſcience guided by his Verdict, is to ſubmit religion to the mercy of a man as fallible as themſelves; to ſlight the judgements of many thouſands, that we may reſt in One as weak as any of theſe we neglect, is to endanger even the being of Religion, that we may the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107126:16"/>better ſecure its Circumſtantials. Undeniable is that of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth, He that affirms the Popes infallability, puts himſelf into his hands to be led by him at his pleaſure into all Hereſie (eſpecially ſeeing it is notoriouſly evident that many of them have been Hereticks, and tis Granted they may be ſo) and even to hell it ſelf, and cannot with reaſon ſay (ſo long as he is conſtant to his Grounds)</hi> cur ita facis, <hi>but muſt believe white to be black and black to be white; vertue to be vice, nay (which is moſt Horrible, yet a certain truth) Chriſt to be Antichriſt, and Antichriſt to be Chriſt, if it be poſſible for the Pope (who hath been known to eſteem the Goſpel a very fable) ſo to ſay. Which I ſay and maintain, however you daub and diſguiſe it, is indeed to make men Apoſtate from Chriſt, to his pretended Vicar but real enemy.</hi> Laſtly, to ſubmit to him ſo, as not to bind our Conſciences to conſent, but our ſelves not to practice or declare contrary to his determinations, is (1) That which our Author and his party explode as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; (2) Tis very Dangerous, ſeeing by theſe means the practice of Religion, the worſhip of Jeſus may be exploded in moſt Churches in Chriſtendome, the witneſſes of the truth ſilenced, and men be hindred from confeſſing with their mouths the Lord Jeſus, which yet is neceſſary to ſalvation. Yea (3) Is it not more ſafe to ſubmit to any particular provincial Council in this matter then to one man, and to a General one (when it may be had) then to that?

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I cannot tell what you would imagine in anſwer to this ſtale argument, but I can tell what returns have been made to it, before ere it was managed by the Presbyter. And had they not been like you, at leaſt ſome of them, in overlooking Anſwers given to their Arguments, they might have ſpared all their pains in this particular. (1.) Then, let
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107126:16"/>
                  <hi>Ocham</hi> tell us, the ſame form of Government is not alwayes moſt expedient for the whole and for each part, ſeeing one may ſuſtain the Hearing, Diſpatching and Determining the greater cauſes and more important matters in one Kingdom, or Country; but no one can ſo manage the weightieſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole world; In like ſort, though it be expedient (<hi>ſc.</hi> for the preventing of Schiſm) that there ſhould be one Biſhop over ſome part of the Church, yet there is not the ſame reaſon, that there ſhould be one over the whole;

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſaith he, it would be moſt dangerous, to aſſign any particular perſon as the ſupream ruler of the whole Church; for if he ſhould fall into Errour or Hereſie, all the whole would be in great danger of ſeduction by him; the members for the moſt part conforming themſelves to the head (eſpecially when they are taught, that he is Infallible.) Out of all that hath been ſaid, we have three Anſwers. (1.) That the Argument is not good from a Biſhop to a Pope; becauſe the one is able to hear and diſpatch Cauſes ſo as to prevent Schiſm, which the other is not. (2.) That this Argument will as well prove an Univerſal Monarch, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once granted that Monarchy in a particular Province is the beſt Government for the preventing of Political Schiſm. (3.) If it were expedient to prevent Schiſm, yet the danger and miſchief of it would be worſe then the diſeaſe, whereas no ſuch thing can be aſſerted of a regular Epiſcopacy. But (2) I anſwer that in reſpect of a Dioceſs, or Pariſh, there is a particular Authority reſting in one, and therefore if this one Miniſter of a Pariſh ſhould have <hi>Authoritatem</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, all might be fild with Schiſms; ſo alſo Biſhops may abuſe their peculiar Authority, and therefore to the prevention of Schiſm, tis meet they ſhould have an Authority to bound them; But now for a Metropolitan, he hath no juriſdiction over Biſhops he can do nothing (out of his own Dioceſs, in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107126:17"/>which he is a Biſhop) without the concurrence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of the Biſhops of the province, though he be in order and honour the firſt; ſo in like ſort, the Patriarch may do nothing without the advice and conſent of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans and Biſhops ſubject to him; ſeeing therefore theſe have no power of Juriſdiction, but only a Primacy of Order and Honour, there needs none over them, eſpecially with a power of Juriſdiction, to prevent their Schiſms; ſo then (ſaith <hi>Cham.</hi>

                     <hi>De Oecum. Pontiſ.</hi> l 9. <hi>c.</hi> 14. ſ. 12.</note>) here is a ridiculous compariſon of things diſlike,
<q>as if one ſhould ſay, Tis convenient, that there ſhould be one Primate over Biſhops, but ſo as to be able to do nothing without their ſentence; therefore there ought to to be one over theſe Primates, endued with full power of juriſdiction.</q> (3.) The Fathers, which are for one Biſhop over Presbyters, upon the account that Schiſm might be prevented, yet never reſorted to this one Univerſal Biſhop for the ſame end; but redreſſed all Schiſm by calling Synods; neither is there any Unity implyed in the whole Church, or Churches of divers Provinces, which may not be preſerved by the multitude of divers Paſtors, conſpiring and conſenting together, as well as by the Unity of one chief Paſtour. And in this ſort we ſhall find the Church of God to have ſtood in perfect Unity in the firſt and beſt ages thereof, without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any want of the help of one chief Paſtour. Oh but Oecumenical Synods cannot be had alwayes. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nor is it needful: for the moſt part Provincal ones will ſerve the turn; But if the Schiſm be very dangerous, and betwixt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and Province,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apud Cham. ibid. c.</hi> 13. ſ. 10.</note> then will Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> tell us (not that we muſt run to him, but) that we wuſt neceſſarily have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a Synod, <hi>quam quidem donec conſequamur, expedit medelam Calamitatis hujus committere voluntati Magni Dei, ac Chriſti ejus, Domini noſtri,</hi> who will be ſure to provide ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for his Church. And indeed to what purpoſe ſhould they go to one man, till it can be proved, and not Begged, that God hath ſet him over the perſons that are to be reconciled? will his Verdict put an end to their Schiſm, that think him as fallible as themſelves? And can we think that God appointed ſuch a Mediator. whom all the world in caſe of Trial would undoubtedly refuſe, till they had evidence of his infallibility,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107126:17"/>or the Delegacy of his power from Chriſt, and yet not give us one Iota to perſwade us of his will in this matter? What he hath in the third ſection of the ſixth Chapter, are but the preſumptuous Dictates of a bold Romaniſt in deſpite of truth, as our Anſwers to the Fathers alledged by him will evidence. Thus having anſwered his reaſons for the ſupream juriſdiction of the Pope, we come now to conſider, what he hath to return upon the Doctor.</p>

                  <hi>that not the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, but lawful exerciſing of ſupremacy of power and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is ſo far from being an impudent oppoſition to the precept, that it is eſtabliſhed by the Text,</hi> for as much as it makes <hi>mention of ſome that are Chief.</hi> To this ſtale argument, it hath been Anſwered, that to argue from this, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.44. <hi>Whoſoever will be chief,</hi> that there was one appointed to be chief among the Apoſtles, is as ridiculous, as from <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.48. <hi>He that is leaſt among you, the ſame ſhall be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> to argue, that there was ſome one Apoſtle of leſs power and dignity then any of the reſt; or from <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.26. <hi>He that is Chief, as he that doth ſerve,</hi> that ſome of the Apoſtles waited upon the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He tells us, that <hi>this is ſo evident, in the next verſe,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that had the Doctor but rehearſed it, he would have publiſhed to his meaneſt reader his abuſe of Scripture.</hi> It ſeems the Doctor is very much to blame: but let us hear the Objection, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will lend him, which is this, that our Saviour gives them his example to confirm his Exhortation, who <hi>ſurely</hi> had <hi>Authority, yea Supremacy of Juriſdiction over the Church; How then are they to imitate Chriſt? in renouncing their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority? did he himſelf do ſo? No. Well then, they are to do it in keeping their humility with that ſupremacy of Juriſdiction. Anſw.</hi> This Argument hath been anſwered ſeveral times, by telling <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that tis true, in Chriſt there was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, as well as humility, but the latter only was the thing propounded to their imitation; thence therefore to infer, that this ſupremacy of power is not inconſiſtent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107126:18"/>with that Command of his, is as vain a Fancy, as becauſe he that Commanded them his humility, thought it no roberry to be equal with God; thence to infer, that therefore this humility was not inconſiſtent with the pride of <hi>Lucifer.</hi> (2) Chriſt though he had this power, yet never exerciſed it upon Earth, but was in the form of a ſervant, and this he propounds to their imitation.</p>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Abalenſ. in</hi> Math. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 83.</note> that the Apoſtles even to the laſt contended who ſhould be greateſt, which ſure they would not have done, if they had thought that <hi>Peter</hi> by the giving of the Keyes or any other act of Chriſt was preferred before them. Yea tis wonderful, that when (as our Adverſaries ſay) this contention came before Chriſt, four ſeveral times, he would never intimate to them, that which was ſo neceſſary to prevent Schiſm, that he intended St. <hi>Peter</hi> for the chief: when thoſe that contended for it ſo ſtrongly, and eſpecially their Followers, were not

<note place="margin">P. 71. ſ. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That he will acknowledge all the twelve Apoſtles to be equally foundations of the Churches building, and that the ſame Authority that was firſt given to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>was afterward given to the reſt of the Apoſtles, that</hi> (<hi>as St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>ſaith</hi>) <hi>the ſame that</hi> Peter <hi>was, the reſt of the Apoſtles likewiſe were, endowed with an equal participation of Honour and Power.</hi> Thus he; but I doubt he will hereafter be more cautious of ſuch liberal conceſſions; for out of theſe I argue <hi>ad hominem</hi> (1.) The ſame that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was, the reſt of the Apoſtles likewiſe were; But St. <hi>Peter</hi> by the verdict of the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> was Prince of the Apoſtles: <hi>ergo,</hi> The reſt of the Apoſtles were Princes over St. <hi>Peter.</hi> (2.) St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a ſupremacy of power over the whole Church; but the reſt of the Apoſtles had equal power with him, <hi>ergo,</hi> The reſt of the Apoſtles had a ſupremacy over the whole Church, and conſequently every member beſide themſelves. Now then, either Chriſt, who gave them this power, gave them a liberty to exerciſe it, or forbad them the external adminiſtration of it. If the firſt, then was there no ſubordination in the exerciſe of this power, to <hi>Peter,</hi> unleſs the ſame perſon can be ſub and equal too; If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, then did he give them it perfectly in vain; for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can be to no end, but to exerciſe it on thoſe, over whom tis given; Nay tis a contradiction to ſay a man hath power over another, when he cannot exerciſe it <hi>de jure,</hi> when as power over him ſuppoſes a right to exerciſe Authority: and when will they be able to evince ſuch a prohibition? Yea (3) how have they equal power (not to ſpeak of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) whereof one may exerciſe authority over the world, the other may not? by the ſame reaſon it may be ſaid that a Presbyter hath equal power with a Biſhop. Well, but ſaith our Author, we muſt give leave to Scripture and Fathers to interpret themſelves; then it follows,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>We grant therefore</hi> (as if <hi>we Benedictines</hi> were Scripture and Fathers) <hi>that all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and all Biſhops their ſucceſſours, enjoy the whole latitude of Epiſcopal juriſdiction, for as much as concerns the internal

<note place="margin">See Mr <hi>C.</hi> Pag. 73. Pag. 71.</note> Is it, that Chriſt gave him the name of a Rock? ſurely no; ſeeing we have it acknowledged, that all the reſt of the Apoſtles were equally foundations of the Church, and conſequently equally Rocks; for <hi>Peter</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo, becauſe our Saviour tells him he would build his Church upon him, or becauſe he was one, upon which the Church was to be founded.

And ſo ſtill nothing pertains to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the matter of being a Stone, or foundation, which doth not appear equally to belong to the others alſo. Yea laſtly, <hi>Peter</hi> is not called a <hi>Rock,</hi> as the Romaniſts would have him; for ſeeing upon this Rock the Church was built, and <hi>Peter</hi> was a member of that Church, it would follow hence, that <hi>Peter</hi> and all the Popes his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours muſt be built upon themſelves; Evident is that of St.

We know that all the time of Chriſts life, <hi>John</hi> had the dignity of place next Chriſt; (for he was the Diſciple whom he loved, and who lay in his boſom) and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> had not the ſuperiority.

               <p>Nor, 3 Was this power of Adminiſtration given him,
<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>C.</hi> pag. 73.</note> becauſe Chriſt bids him <hi>feed his Sheep</hi> indefinitely; For ſure the other Apoſtles were commiſſionated to feed them too; and that they were to do it indefinitely, appears, becauſe they are ſent by him <hi>to all Nations,</hi> not fixt to any part of his flock.

And, whereas 'tis argued, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> is conſtituted Paſtor of Chriſts flock indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore of the Apoſtles, ſeeing they are Chriſts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107126:20"/>Sheep, may it not with equal reaſon be concluded, that ſeeing the Apoſtles had commiſſion given to teach all Nations, and every creature, they were commiſſionated teachers of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and he ought to be ſubject to them, as a Diſciple to his Teacher?

                  <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> will tell us, <hi>That there was none greater than bleſſed St.</hi> Paul, <hi>nay nor equal to him: That he, as another</hi> Aaron, <hi>was anointed Prieſt over the whole world: That he was a Pillar of the Church, more firm</hi> (not only than <hi>Peter,</hi> but) <hi>than any ſtone, rock, or iron: To whom the univerſal dispenſation through the whole world was committed. And</hi> (which is moſt obſervable) <hi>that he governed the whole world as one houſe, or one ſhip: In which ſhip</hi> (as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us) <hi>Chriſt is the foundation, the Father is the Pilot, the Holy Spirit</hi> Proram ſervat, <hi>and which the twelve Apoſtles, as her bank of Oares bring into the Haven.</hi> So that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107126:20"/>here is no peculiar place aſſigned to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Now then theſe things being ſo, I argue thus; Either in theſe places, our Saviour did give St. <hi>Peter</hi> this external adminiſtration, or he did not; if he did, then it follows evidently, that he gave the ſame power to the Apoſtles alſo, ſeeing what he gave to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we have proved he gave to them; if not, then let them tell us, where Chriſt gave this power to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and what more likely arguments can be produced to conclude it. 2. It is manifeſt, 1. That Chriſt immediately conſtituted Apoſtles, and that they received not their Apoſtleſhip from St. <hi>Peter;</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>have not I choſen you twelve?</hi> Joh. 6.70. Joh. 20.21. <hi>as my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> 2. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that Chriſt gave ſupream juriſdiction to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Apoſtles; and this your <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Pontiſ. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</note> yea <hi>that he gave them all power,</hi> whether external or internal; yea he proves it too; 1. <hi>Becauſe he ſaith, as my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you, whoſeſoever ſins ye remit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt without all controverſie was ſent with full and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power,</hi> and therefore his Apoſtles muſt be ſo; and this Expoſition or Argument from the place, he backs with the Fathers; and <hi>Maldonate</hi> with <hi>Janſenius</hi> ſay the like. 2.
<note place="margin">In locum.</note> He proves it hence, <hi>that the Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul <hi>making mention of the diſtinct orders of officers in the Church, doth it thus; firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſecondarily Teachers, thirdly Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. And this he doth, when his deſign is to ſhew that ſome part of the Church hath more abundant honour than the reſt; and having done ſo, puts the queſtion, Are all Apoſtles? can they all plead to equal power with them? Now had there been one ſupream over the Apoſtles, why doth he ſay in general, firſt Apoſtles? when 'tis his deſign to ſpeak of the degrees which God had placed in the Church: why doth he leave out the chief? <hi>Certainly if the Apoſtles were all firſt,
<note place="margin">Chilling.</note> to me it is very probable, that no one was before the other; for by firſt all men underſtand, either that which is before all, or that before which is nothing; Now in the former ſence, the Apoſtles could not be all firſt; for then every one of them muſt be before every one of the reſt; (or if you ſay, that all the Apoſtles were before all other Paſtors, but St.</hi> Peter <hi>firſt of all, then why doth not the Apoſtle ſay firſt St.</hi> Peter, <hi>then the reſt of the Apoſtles?) and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107126:21"/>therefore they muſt be firſt in the other ſence, and therefore no man, and therefore not St.</hi> Peter <hi>muſt be before them. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> elſewhere ſaith, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not of the Hierarchy of the Church, but of thoſe that were indowed with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts, and that therefore he leaves out St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But, 1. What doth he think of Teachers, were they extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſons? 2. If this be the reaſon, why have we no mention of him <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. where we have Paſtors, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Prophets, Apoſtles, (without any diſtinction) ſet over us, <hi>till we all come in the unity of faith unto perfect men?</hi> 3. He proves it, becauſe they had commiſſion from Chriſt to go teach all Nations, and out of thoſe whom they taught, to ordain ſome Paſtors whereever they came; which ſhews they had an univerſal juriſdiction from Chriſt, and a power to exerciſe it: and ſo much for the ſecond propoſition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it follows, that they could not be limited in this power by St. <hi>Peter;</hi> for <hi>Par in parem non habet poteſtatem.</hi> Now to reſtrain anothers power as to its exerciſe, is evidently to exerciſe power over him; And hence it follows, that they had equal power of Adminiſtration with St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have authority over all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and yet not exerciſe one act of it upon them, and that they ſhould ſhew to him no ſign of ſubjection, methinks is as ſtrange, as that a King of <hi>England</hi> for 24 years ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe no act of regality, nor receive any one acknowledgement of it; as ſtrange methinks it is, that you ſo many ages after ſhould know this ſo certainly, as you pretend to, and yet the Apoſtles (after theſe words were ſpoken in their hearing, by vertue whereof St. <hi>Peter</hi> is pretended to have been made their head) ſhould ſtill be ſo ignorant of it, as to queſtion which of them ſhould be the greateſt; yet more ſtrange, that our Saviour ſhould not bring them out of their error by telling them St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the man; No leſs a wonder was it, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo far ſhould forget St. <hi>Peter</hi> and himſelf, as that 1. Mentioning him often, he ſhould do it without any title of honour, yea further, that ſpeaking of himſelf in particular, and perhaps comparing himſelf with St. <hi>Peter</hi> rather than any other, he ſhould ſay in plain terms, I am in nothing behind the very chiefeſt of the Apoſtles. How is it, that the other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107126:21"/>Apoſtles fall foul upon St. <hi>Peter</hi> for going in unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23. ſo that he is compelld to defend himſelf by that ſpecial revelation made unto him? How is it that he paſſed not the Decretorial ſentence in the Synod? <hi>Acts</hi> 15. did he transfer his power to St. <hi>James?</hi>

Why doth he mention them all as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and put no difference betwixt them, if indeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> were Superiour to them? eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it be conſidered that he elſewhere calls them (if we may believe St. <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theophylact, Oecum.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but in particular) that even St. <hi>Peter</hi> the chief of the Apoſtles had given him the right hand of fellowſhip? and therefore his neglecting of this is a ſhrewd argument againſt this Supremacy; and perſwades me to believe with the Doctor, that St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> were St. <hi>Peters</hi> Peers. Again, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. the Apoſtle tells us, that even theſe Pillars ſaw it evident, that <hi>the Goſpel of the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was committed to him, as the Goſpel of the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to St.</hi> Peter, and that hereupon it was agreed, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> with his companions <hi>ſhould go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the Jews,</hi> or circumciſion.

               <p n="3">3. 'Tis further argued, that if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been Prince of the Apoſtles, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have had the confidence to reſiſt him to the very face: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will tell us, that an inferior may rebuke a ſuperior.</p>

                  </gap>) that he charges him of not walking uprightly, not agreeably to the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but doing things for which he deſerved to be rebuked by him, and all this without the leaſt ſhew of reverence, and ſubmiſſion, without any artificial preface, begging the pardon, or deprecating the anger and diſpleaſure of his Superior, which ſeems ſufficiently to argue that he did not thus eſteem him. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> had rounded the High Prieſt, and told him that God would ſmite him for judging and condemning him to be ſmitten contrary to the Law, how preſently doth he correct himſelf upon information given that he ſpake to the High Prieſt? and when he takes up St. <hi>Peter</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, might he not as truly have ſaid, I wiſt not that he was the High Prieſt, the Prince of the Apoſtles?

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and that the cauſe was determined by his ſentence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this the ſame Doctor Anſwers, <hi>That here was no appeal from an inferiour to a ſuperiour, but only a deſire of help from the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>who accordingly writes to</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>tells him what was to be done in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the rules of juſtice; accordingly the Patriarch though he diſlikes the interpoſing of the Pope, yet it ſeems he doth juſtice to the injured perſon,
<note place="margin">Pope <hi>Leo</hi> pretended the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> and <hi>P. Julias</hi> in the matter of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>
                     </note> and this is the defining of the cauſe here ſpoken of;</hi> And where he talks of the Canons of the Church, the Doctor calls it a <hi>pretence of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> a device which ſometimes Popes made uſe of. Thus <hi>Zezimus</hi> pretended the Canons of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council for the ſubjecting the <hi>Africans</hi> unto him, but was found a falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, as you may ſee in the learned <hi>Chamier;</hi> and what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if his ſucceſſors were in this his followers?</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if there were ſuch Canons as allowed appeals, to this end that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> might admoniſh the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. All this falls ſhort of an univerſal Juriſdiction, which <hi>Valentinian</hi> being only Emperour of the Weſt, could not be imagined to confer upon the Pope, nor can his Edict be ſuppoſed to reach thoſe Biſhops which came not within the compaſs of his Empire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider who was it that made this Edict; <hi>Valentinian</hi> a young Emperour, and as yet <hi>ſub poteſtate matris;</hi> yea ſaith the great <hi>Salmaſius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Papae,</hi> c. 17.</note> it was procured a <hi>Principe intertiſſimo, imbelli, deſidiaque ac luxurie perditiſſimo.</hi> And further, againſt whom was it framed? even againſt pious and learned St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> a man acquainted I preſume with the antient cuſtomes of the Church, as well as this young Emperour or his inſtructer Pope <hi>Leo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This Law was got from him by the ſuggeſtion and falſe dealing of the Pope, and that manifeſtly ambitious of and yawning after this Supremacy: and hence it is that the Edict ſaith, <hi>Hilary</hi> (<hi>as we have found by the faithful relation of that venerable man the Pope of</hi> Rome) <hi>vindicates his unjuſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops uſed only out of temerity, not conſulting</hi> Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem Romanae Eccleſiae; which is ſufficient evidence (ſaith <hi>Salmaſius</hi>) that this Edict was put forth by the arts and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifex; as alſo he gathers from another clauſe, <hi>viz. Sola manſueti praeſulis humanitas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit Hilarium adhuc Epiſcopum nominari,</hi> words that ſmell rank of a Pope, and are exactly parallel to what <hi>Leo</hi> writes in his Epiſtle to the Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Vienna;</hi> that as for St. <hi>Hilary, ſuae civitatis ſacerdotium pro ſedis Apoſtolicae pietate perceptio noſtra ſervaverit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. (Saith he) he reſtrains the authority of the Pope, and will have it only acknowledged, <hi>Si quid a quopiam contra ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terem conſuetudinem tentaeretur;</hi> and in the beginning of his Edict <hi>ne quid praeter authoritatem ſedis Romanae illicitum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptio
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107126:28"/>adtentare nitatur,</hi> and therefore the Pope hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, when all things are done rightly, and according <hi>to ancient cuſtom,</hi> ſo that this Edict ſends us only to look what that was.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He ſums up all and concludes that this Edict ſhould not ſeem to have much authority, if it be conſidered that it was ſuggeſted by a falſe relation, (<hi>viz.</hi> that St. <hi>Hilary</hi> did againſt right and the antient cuſtoms, in ordaining Biſhops without conſulting the Pope, which is very falſe) that this relation was made by him whoſe intereſt it was to ſay ſo, and who was manifeſtly ambitious to Lord it over Gods Heritage, that this Edict was made, St. <hi>Hilary</hi> not being heard to plead for himſelf; that it was extorted from a young Prince and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of theſe things.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, That this Edict had very little or no authority in following times; for divers Councils (a thing which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the height of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and which <hi>Leo</hi> for bad to <hi>Hilary</hi>) were called without the authority of the Pope, in divers parts and Cities of <hi>France,</hi> to define weighty matters of Faith and Diſcipline; thus we find it in <hi>Synodis, Agathenſi prima, Epaunenſi, Aurelienſibus aliquot, Turonenſi, Matiſconenſi, Avernenſi,</hi> and many more, all affirming that they came together, <hi>Solo deo authore ac moderatore,</hi> and by the permiſſion, or command of the Emperour, whither he were <hi>Gothus Burgundus, vel Francus;</hi> and thus I hope Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath little cauſe to brag of the weight this teſtimony carries with it, eſpecially ſeeing were it all as true as Goſpel, yet doth it not reach to a <hi>jus divinum,</hi> and ſo is mutable.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107126:31"/>excelled him in Virtue, and Sanctity of life; they objected alſo againſt him as a crime, that he had communicated with <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and the other Biſhops, and that they could not indure to ſee their ſentence made invalid by him, as if it were by a Council;</q> ſo that what he did was by way of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and not by Right: and that which our Author cites out of <hi>Theodoret</hi> for the contrary is very diſingenuous.

               <p n="3">3. The Affricans took no notice of this Decree,

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely there may be three reaſons given of his ſo doing; <q>the firſt becauſe he was nearer to them then St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</hi> The ſecond becauſe he as Patriarch of the Weſt, with his Biſhops was more likely to prevail, then <hi>Cyprian</hi> with his Africans only. The third for that as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth in the end of the Epiſtle, it more concerned him then any other, to maintain the reputation of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> his predeceſſors, and to oppoſe himſelf againſt <hi>Martianus,</hi> who joined himſelf with <hi>Novatianus,</hi> that had Schiſmatically divided himſelf from them, and made a breach in the Church.</q> But you will ſay that he is bid to write, <hi>commanding</hi> that <hi>Marcianus</hi> be excommunicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True Mr. <hi>C.</hi> tells us ſo, but tis his own addition; for <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith only, <hi>let Letters be directed to the people, and Province of</hi> Arles, <hi>quibus abſtento</hi> Marciano; by <hi>reaſon of which</hi> Marcian <hi>being excommunicated (viz</hi> by the Biſhops following his advice) <hi>another may be ſubſtituted in his room,</hi> viz. choſen by the people with the directions of the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> as appears from his words, <hi>(qua propter facere te oportet pleniſſimas literas, ad coëpiſcopos noſtros in Gallia conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutos, ne ultra Marcianum pervicacem &amp; ſuperbum, &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae pietatis, ac fraternae ſalutis inimicum, collegio noſtro in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultare patiantur)</hi> and yet if all this anſwer was waved, the inſtance infers this only that the Pope had power over <hi>France,</hi> as being Patriarch, not over the whole world, as univerſal Biſhop.</p>
               <p>That which he cites out of the ſixty eighth Epiſtle,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> is to this effect; <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes to the Clergy and People of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they had rightly depoſed <hi>Baſilides,</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi> and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in their room <hi>Sabinus,</hi> and <hi>Faelix,</hi> and that it was not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107126:34"/>ſufficient to reſcind their ordination;
<q>That <hi>Baſilides</hi> after his crime manifeſted, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there deceived <hi>Stephen,</hi> being far diſtant from <hi>Spain,</hi> and ignorant of the thing done, and of the truth concealed, to the intent that he might requeſt <hi>(Exaembiret)</hi> to be injuſtly repoſed in his Biſhoprick, from which he was juſtly depoſed; <hi>Stephen</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon with his Biſhops communicateth with him, and ſo (as much as in them lyeth) reſtoreth him to his former Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick. <hi>Cyprian</hi> condemneth the falſe and ill dealing of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> and reproveth alſo the negligence of <hi>Stephen,</hi> that ſuffered himſelf ſo eaſily to be miſled, taxing him, and ſuch as conſented with him, for communicating with ſuch wicked ones, ſhewing that they are partakers of their ſins, and that they violate the Canon of the Church, which the Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi>
                  </q> and all the Biſhops of the world, yea even <hi>Cornelius</hi> the predeceſſour of this <hi>Stephen</hi> had conſented on to wit,
<q>That men ſo defiled with Idolatry, as <hi>Martialis</hi> and <hi>Baſilides</hi> were, ſhould be received to penitency, but be kept from all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical honour; theſe are the circumſtances of <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epiſtle, wherein he relateth the proceedings againſt <hi>Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi> juſtly put from their office and dignity, and the inconſiderate courſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> haſtily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with them; whereby we may ſee how wiſely and adviſedly, our adverſaries urge <hi>Cyprian</hi> to prove, that in antient times the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had power to reſtore ſuch Biſhops to their places again, as were depoſed by others; for thus they muſt reaſon from this place of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> if they will make any uſe of it, <hi>Baſilides,</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi> juſtly put from their office, fly to <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> hoping by his means to procure the reverſing of that which was done againſt them; he with ſuch as adheared to him, though they could not reſtore them to their places, yet communicated with them; <hi>Cyprian</hi> offended herewith chargeth <hi>Baſilides</hi> with execrable wickedneſs, for abuſing <hi>Stephen,</hi> and miſinforming him, and <hi>Stephen</hi> with intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble negligence, and unexcuſable violation of the Canons, for partaking with ſuch wicked perſons, and wiſheth all his Brethren, and Colleagues conſtantly to hold on their courſe againſt them, notwithſtanding the failing of <hi>Stephen,</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:107126:35"/>and his adherents; therefore the Antient Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> reſtored to their places ſuch as were judicially depoſed by others, and were acknowledged by the Fathers to have power and authority ſo to do;</q> which kind of reaſoning is like all the reſt in this Chapter, that is, evidently weak; but happily you will ſay, Why doth not <hi>Cyprian</hi> tell them, that the Pope hath not power to reſtore them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doth he yet not ſufficiently, in adviſing them to hold on their courſe againſt them, which ſure he would not have done had he acknowledged any ſuch power in the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> for this would have been to contradict lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is diſcontented with the proceedings of theſe Biſhops, in going to <hi>Stephen</hi> ſo far diſtant, which ſure he would not have been, if he had thought him to have had ſuch an univerſal Juriſdiction, as our Author pleads for; no certainly, theſe words ſavour ſtrongly of what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us of <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> their appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> when condemned in <hi>Africk, Ep.</hi> 55. <hi>ad Cornelium,</hi> that it is juſt and equal, that every ones cauſe ſhould be there heard, where the crime is committed, and that it behoved not their Biſhops over whom they were ſet, to run about (as theſe did to <hi>Rome</hi>) but to plead their cauſe there, where their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, and their witneſſes might be had, unleſs a few deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wretches will think, that the authority of the Biſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> is leſs, <hi>(viz. then that to which they run)</hi> What evaſions are made againſt this ſaying of <hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and <hi>Pamelius,</hi> are taken off by <hi>Chamier</hi> in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Book,

               <p>Another negative Argument we have from Pope <hi>Victors</hi> excommunicating the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> as differing from him in the Celebration of the Eaſtern Feſtival; now here ſaith he, <hi>It was not imputed to</hi> Victor <hi>by</hi> Irenaeus <hi>or</hi> Polycrates, <hi>that he exerciſed an uſurped Authority over Biſhops not ſubject to him; ergo,</hi> he had Authority over theſe <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. This</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Chillingworth) is to ſuppoſe that excommunication is an act, or Argument, or ſign of Power and Authority in the party excommunicating, over the party excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107126:35"/>whereas it is undeniably evident out of the Church ſtory, that it was often uſed by Inferiors upon Superiors, and by Equals upon Equals, if the Equals or Inferiors thought their Equals or Superiors did any thing which deſerved it.</hi>

<q>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will but read over that Book, ſhall find moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and undoubtedly, that he ſpeaketh not in that Book of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Headſhip of the univerſal Church as our Author phanſieth, but of the Head Original; and firſt beginning of Paſtoral commiſſion, which he makes appear by laying down the principal and moſt material circumſtances of this Book, written upon occaſion of the Schiſm of the Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; The firſt thing that occurs in the whole diſcourſe of the Book, is the obſervation of the malice of Satan, in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Schiſms and Hereſies to ſubvert the faith. 2. He ſheweth, that this ſo falls out, becauſe men return not back to the firſt Origen of Truth, becauſe they ſeek not the Head, nor keep the doctrine of the Heavenly Maſter; which if a man would conſider, there would be no need of many Arguments, but the truth without any great ſearch would offer it ſelf unto him; for therefore did Chriſt when he was to lay the foundations of the Chriſtian Church, ſay eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>Peter,</hi> Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and upon this Rock will I build my Church: and again after the Reſurrection, Feed my ſheep, becauſe, though riſing again from the dead, he gave like power to all the Apoſtles, when he ſaid, As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you; Whoſe ſins ye remit, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 20.21, 23. Yet he would by ſpeaking eſpecially to one, and by appointing one Chair, ſhew what unity ſhould be in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107126:36"/>Church; the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> were undoubtedly the ſame that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was, equal in honour and power, but therefore did Chriſt in the firſt place give, or at leaſt promiſe to give; eſpecially, or particularly to one, that Apoſtolick Commiſſion which he meant alſo to give to the reſt, that he might thereby ſhew that the Church muſt be one, and that there muſt be but one Epiſcopal Chair in the World; all the Apoſtles ſaith <hi>Cyprian</hi> are Paſtors, but the Flock of Chriſt is but one, which they are to feed with unanimous conſent; there is but one Body of the Church, one Spirit, one Hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God; this unity all men muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep, eſpecially Biſhops, that they may make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that there is but one Epiſcopal Commiſſion in the Chriſtian Church, <hi>cujus à ſingulis in ſolidum pars tenetur,</hi> whereof every one indifferently, and in equal ſort hath his part: Here is nothing that proveth the univerſality of the Papal power, but this place moſt plainly overthroweth it; for <hi>Cyprian</hi> teacheth, that Chriſt meant to give equal Power and Authority to all his Apoſtles; and the reaſon why in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending no more to one than to the reſt, yet he more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially directed his ſpeech to one than to the reſt, was only to ſhew that there muſt be an unity in the Church, which He ſettled in that beginning with one, from him he proceeded to the reſt, not meaning that the reſt ſhould receive any thing from him, but that from himſelf immediately they ſhould receive that in the <hi>ſecond place,</hi> which he had <hi>firſt,</hi> and that they ſhould receive the ſame Commiſſion together with him, into which he was put firſt, that they might know him to be the firſt of their Company; for it cannot conſiſt (ſaith he) either with truth, with the opinion of St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> or of our Adverſaries themſelves, that the reſt of the Apoſtles received their Miniſterial Power from <hi>Peter,</hi> and were ſubject to him, as to an Head and abſolute Commander over them, ſeeing he ſaith expreſly that they were the ſame that <hi>Peter</hi> was, and equal to him both in honour, and power; and beſides both in this book, and in many other places, he is wont to derive the original of Schiſms, and Hereſies, from the intruſion of men into places, without due admittance

                  <hi>That the Roman Biſhop in his Patriarchate is made the pattern of the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>not in regard of his univerſal juriſdiction in the Church of God,</hi> (which in that time was not in being) <hi>but only as to his cuſtome and practice of calling Synods, correcting manners, making ordinations

                  <hi>That</hi> Gregory <hi>did not ſo much combat</hi> Johns <hi>preſent intention as the probable conſequences of ſuch a title, which might argue that beſides himſelf there were no Biſhops in the Church; for if he were the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop and the whole world his Dioceſs, ſince by the Canons there can be but one Biſhop in a place, it would fellow that all others were only Biſhops in Name, and by their Character had no other office, but as his ſubſtitutes, depending on his will, whereas the Apoſtles received their Office and Authority immediately from our Lord himſelf. Anſ.</hi> This is a profound Argument which <hi>Gregory</hi> (I am confident) would have been aſhamed of; for if the Pope be Univerſal Biſhop (whether we ſtile him ſo or not) is not the whole World his Dioceſs? hath he not Authority to exerciſe the functions of a General Biſhop in the whole World? and then doth it not follow with the ſame evidence of reaſon, that all the Biſhops of the World are only titular? 2. He manifeſtly oppoſeth receiving a right of Juriſdiction from any but Chriſt, and a receiving it from an Univerſal Biſhop, when he ſaith, <hi>The Biſhops</hi> (the Succeſſors of the Apoſtle) <hi>would never acknowledge the receiving of their Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal right of Juriſdiction from any but Chriſt himſelf,</hi> not from an Univerſal Biſhop as the words preceding manifeſtly ſhew; and yet he preſently gives a reaſon which ſhews theſe two to be moſt conſiſtent; for ſaith he, <hi>Though a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Biſhop be ordained by a Metropolitan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> (might he not have ſaid, or Univerſal Biſhop?) <hi>and his Juriſdiction be given him by them, they indeed are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt to conveigh his Authority, but the inherent Authority it ſelf Chriſt only gives him;</hi> by whoſe means I pray you? ſuppoſing him ordained by the Pope, is it not by the means of the Univerſal Biſhop? 3. 'Tis plain and evident, that <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks againſt this title as that which argued the ſubjection of all other Biſhops and Patriarchs to him, as appears from theſe paſſages.

               </p>

And though we make uſe of univerſal tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet not as a rule, but as a motive or argument for our faith, as one argument that evidenceth the Scripture to be Gods word, is the atteſtation of the Church in all ages (which upon rational grounds we embrace as creditable) to confirm and conveigh this to us: and this uſe we may make

Though (that I may not be miſtaken) I allow the four firſt a preheminence above the enſuing Oecumenical Councils, (were there any ſuch) becauſe from their nearneſs to the Apoſtolical times, they had <hi>greater advantage</hi> of being acquainted with the Apoſtles minds and practices; but then the preheminence we grant them above others, is derived from the <hi>probability</hi> of their <hi>conſonancy</hi> with that which we avow to be infallible. We appeal therefore to the four firſt general Councils, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we think it abſolutely neceſſary to conform our belief to theirs, but <hi>ex abundanti</hi> to ſhew you, that ſhould we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Church, as you would have us, that in the moſt pure and uncorrupted Ages, its belief carried an exact har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with Ours; ſo that were the Church judge (as it is not) the primitive Church would ſtand for us; And this is all we mean in our appeal to the four firſt general Councils.

               <p>We aſſert therefore that Reaſon alone is, and can be our guide which we demonſtrate, becauſe Reaſon alone is our judge in all caſes; for I either have reaſon for my belief, (whatever it be) or I have not; if the latter, then my belief is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Irrational; for my belief muſt be Irrational, when I have no reaſon to believe; and as Irrational, ſo</p>
               <p n="2">2. Altogether uncertain, and its object may as well be a falſehood as a truth, becauſe if I have no reaſon why I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it true, then have I no certainty, but it may be falſe; for the only certainty I can have that my belief is not falſe, is becauſe I have rational grounds to evidence it true, which when removed, what certainty can I have that I do not err? But if the former, that is, If whatſoever I believe or aſſent to, I do it becauſe my reaſon judgeth it a truth, then reaſon is my judge and guide in whatſoever I believe, which is the propoſition to be proved. And this is eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and illuſtrated by a few particular conſiderations; as when the queſtion is, Whether I am bound to embrace any religion at all? I bring my reaſon to judge, which after it hath examined the weight and evidence of the arguments ſuggeſted to it, and found them valid, determines and judges, that I ought to own ſome religion; after this, my next enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, Amongſt the various kinds of Religion profeſſed in the world, which is the true one? here again having examined all their pretences, my reaſon judgeth which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107126:54"/>to truth, and hereupon I cloſe with the Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, becauſe I find their arguments moſt valid, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfactory to an ingenuous and unprejudiced underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuch as carry with them ſo full an evidence, as that it will make all unbelief infinitely irrational. And <hi>hitherto</hi> as reaſon is my only guide, ſo my only rule too; for I can have no other Canon whereby to guide it, but its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Laws and Maximes, by which I examine the verity of all other rules, and therefore can have no other rules whereby to judge, ſeeing they themſelves are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters judged of; and therefore when we diſpute with the Romaniſts, whether Scripture be our ſole rule whereby to determine controverſies, tis not to be taken abſolutely, as if there were no other rule, (for I can never confute a Jew from a text of the new Teſtament, nor an Atheiſt or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel out of either Teſtaments) but limitedly, that its the ſole rule whereby to determine controverſies of faith, among thoſe that profeſs the Chriſtian Religion; in which ſenſe alone it concerns their diſpute, which is not with Infidels, but Chriſtians, who have already acknowledged Scripture to be a rule of faith. But to proceed, having by embracing the Chriſtian Religion received <hi>a new rule,</hi> the <hi>old guide</hi> may ſtill ſuffice; that which could guide me into the right way, will much more guide me in it, eſpecially when its plain and eaſie. But now Chriſtianity is profeſſed, and a new rule owned, my nex <hi>quere</hi> is, what party among the ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders adhere to this rule, and ſo with what Church I muſt join; here again reaſon muſt ſit on the bench, and paſs judgement of all the Churches in the world, which of them keep to the rule of faith, and which ſwerve from it. Let us then firſt call the Socinian Churches to the bar; here the enquiry would be, whether I may embrace any thing for Truth, though ſufficiently manifeſted to be of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, if it ſeem to contradict or thwart my reaſon? hereto reaſon it ſelf muſt be judge, and ſo the enquiry is, whether it be more rational to believe a Truth Divinely revealed that I cannot comprehend, or upon that account to reject it; My reaſon judgeth it moſt rational to captivate and ſubmit it ſelf to infinite Wiſdome, and believe what it cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107126:54"/>becauſe I, and all the World beſide, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſuch things as tranſcend our comprehenſions; <hi>v. g.</hi> an infinite extenſion of ſpace, an eternal duration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore I think not their principle ſufficient to explode a truth for a falſhood; beſide, I know the Divine knowledge and wiſdome is infinite, and ſo incomprehenſible to any ſinite and ſhallow intellect, and therefore that he may know and conſequently reveal ſuch matters which are too deep and too wide to be contained within the bounds of our narrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; and therefore what more abſurd then to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the immenſity of the Divine wiſdome by the ſtandard of our imperfect and ſhort apprehenſions? Wherefore we do not proſcribe the Doctrine imputed to the Socinians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes reaſon <hi>the Judge</hi> (as the Romaniſts would fain perſwade us) but becauſe it makes it <hi>the rule of Faith,</hi> and believes nothing for a truth, but what we can comprehend as to the manner of its exiſtence, that it is; whereas nothing is more evident, then that we may be certain of the being of a thing when we underſtand not the manner of its being. Though I have been already too tedious in this inſtance, yet becauſe I had rather offend by tediouſneſs, or any thing, rather then diſingenuity, I muſt venture a very ſhort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, to avoid dealing diſingenuouſly with the Socinians. When then I charge this principle upon them, I have it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their Adverſaries then from themſelves; for I muſt profeſs, I could never meet with it expreſly aſſerted in their own writings; they will not avow, that they reject mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly revealed Truths, becauſe they ſeem contradict ons; but on the contrary, that they believe not contradictions, becauſe not manifeſtly revealed, and ſo they pretend to explode the Doctrine of the Trinity, not in the firſt place, becauſe it ſeems a contradiction, but becauſe they conceive it not to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered in Scripture; and then after this, they urge againſt it its repugnancy to the principles and common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reaſon; and ſo their principle runs thus, That which is not clearly revealed in Scripture, and is contradictory to reaſon, is not to be believed; and if there were as much truth in the firſt part of their Maxime, as there is in the laſt, there would be one more Socinian in the world then now there is;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107126:55"/>I have ſtayed the longer upon this particular, becauſe as its an irrefragable evidence of reaſons ſoveraignty, ſo is it a full Anſwer to the Objections againſt it; for whereas they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that we muſt captivate and ſubmit our reaſons to Faith, how then can we make them Judges of our Faith? from the the preceding inſtance we Reply, That we even then place reaſon on the Bench, when we ſeem to dethrone it, and at the ſame time make it an Umpire, when we make it a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: But in the laſt place, to come nearer our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to ſhew that the Romaniſts as well as we do at laſt appeal to their private reaſons: If my enquiry were, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or the reformed Churches were the true Church? here neither the Romiſh Church, nor ours muſt be judge, ſeeing they both pretend to it, and both are the pureſt to themſelves: How then ſhall I know which is really ſo? only by examining both their pleas, and then that which I judge to be pureſt, do I adhere to. When Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> renounced the Proteſtant Communion to joyn with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he either did it upon motives of reaſon, or not; if not, it was a brutiſh, unreaſonable act; but if he did, then did he enter into the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his own reaſon judged it to be the pureſt Church; and when he believes his Church infallible, he either hath reaſon for his belief, or he hath not; if he hath not, then again is his belief irrational, uncertain, and abſurd; if he hath, then he believes his Church infallible, becauſe his reaſon judgeth it to be ſo, and ſo the Church is beholden to the judgement of his private reaſon for his belief of her infallibility. And hath not Mr. <hi>C.</hi> given us his reaſons (ſuch as they are) why he judgeth and believeth the Church infallible? to what purpoſe if reaſon be ſo unfit a Judge? and let him do what violence he can to his rational faculties, unleſs he become a meer brute, his own private reaſon will rule him, and in ſpight of Pope or Council keep the Chair. And I dare challenge all the Romaniſts in the World to demonſtrate, that unleſs every mans reaſon be his guide, he muſt follow chance and uncertainty. Before I paſs hence (to avoid captious miſtakes) be pleaſed to note, that when I make every mans reaſon his guide, I do not exclude the guidance of the Divine Spirit, but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107126:55"/>rather imply it; becauſe that doth not move us by irrational and violent impulſes, but by diſcovering to our reaſons a fuller evidence or farther connexion of truths, then without its illumination we could have diſcerned, and ſo forceth our aſſents by a ſtronger conviction of our reaſons, which is the Criterion whereby we difference the impreſſions of the Divine Spirit from deluſory and falſe inſpirations; in that theſe black vapours darken and blaſt our reaſons, and act us by illiterate and brutiſh phantaſmes, whilſt the Spirit of God clarifies our underſtandings and leads us by the rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſobriety. And therefore our Enthuſiaſtical Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are in part Romiſh Proſelytes; for their folly is the ſame, though not in the ſame inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> of quitting the ſurer conduct of their reaſons, to entruſt themſelves to more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain guides, and ſuch as they cannot know (unleſs from their reaſons, which they dare not truſt) but may be meer deluſions and impoſtures.</p>
               <p>Now the only exception,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> following his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, urgeth againſt this Supream Authority of reaſon, is, that its fallible, and ſo may deceive and miſguide us. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If this impeachment be valid, then lets renounce our reaſons, and with one conſent turn Scepticks; how ſhall I be aſſur'd that twice two make four; that the whole is more then a part; that the ſame thing cannot at the ſame time exiſt and not exiſt? I muſt not truſt the judgement of my reaſon, for that may deceive, ſaith Mr. <hi>Creſſey;</hi> what then muſt I confide in? muſt I appeal to a General Council, whether two and two make four?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Can you bring me to a ſurer guide then reaſon? Yes, you will anſwer, to the Church; but if my reaſon being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible may miſguide me, why may it not; when it conducts me to the Church; eſpecially when your ſelves profeſs to believe the Churches infallibility upon prudential motives, if I may not truſt my reaſon, why ſhould I truſt it here? Again, if my conſidence in the Churches infallibility be built upon my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and I have no certainty of it but from my reaſon, then cannot I have more aſſurance in the Churches guidance, then in the conduct of my reaſon; for the ſuperſtructure cannot be ſtronger then the foundation; if then my reaſon be too
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107126:56"/>weak to truſt to, much more that which is built upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What's your meaning, when you object, that reaſon is fallible? is it this, that its poſſible we may be deceived by it? but then, 1. Is it not poſſible the Church may deceive us too? 2. As long as we follow reaſons true rules, its impoſſible to erre, becauſe they are certain and infallibly true. But if men will abuſe their reaſons and bend them to their intereſts, they may ſo, and ſo they may the Churches Authority; and may not the Church abuſe her Authority? will Chriſt violently force her into truth? Give us a guide that cannot be abuſed by wicked and unreaſonable men, or elſe upon that account reject not this. Divine Revelations are abuſed by ſome to undermine our Faith; ſhall they therefore not be allowed to be foundations of it? The queſtion is, What is the ſureſt guide of our Faith? we ſay pure and unprejudiced reaſon, and that if we will follow its dictates, we are in the ſafeſt way to happineſs; and though then we may erre about ſome leſſer truths, becauſe not perſpicuous, yet not about any thing that's a neceſſary Article of Faith. But if men will not follow their own guides, but force them into by-paths, and follow the blind guides of intereſt, prejudice, or paſſion, then they may periſh, not becauſe they follow their free reaſons, but becauſe they either ſtifle, or violently divert them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I would beſeech Mr. <hi>C.</hi> and his brethren, to beware of ſtrengthning the hands of Atheiſts and Scepticks, whilſt they endeavour to weaken ours; for beſide the damages they bring to all. Religion, its no ſmall one they bring to their own; for hereby they ſhew, that upon the ſame grounds that a man is a Papiſt, he may be an Atheiſt too, and that they cannot build their own Religion but upon the ruins of all Religion. For let me ask, will not his exception become an Atheiſts mouth, and be more ſerviceable to his cauſe then to Mr. <hi>Creſſey</hi>'s? What if he ſhould ask, Why do you embrace any Religion? give what account you can, he will enquire what Warrant you have, that you are not deceived? what aſſurance can we give him, if we dare not credit our own ſaculties? and how Mr. <hi>C.</hi> who will not allow us to truſt our own reaſon, will anſwer him, I underſtand not. But I am certain, let him reply what he will, the doubt will ſtill return
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107126:56"/>upon him; for if he take refuge at the Church, the quere will be, how he is certain that the Church doth not deceive him? And imagine he could return an Anſwer, yet unleſs he at laſt appeal to his reaſon, it will ſerve only to give occaſion to a new queſtion. But though Mr. <hi>C.</hi> by his principles cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a Sceptick, yet by ours we may ſatisfactorily anſwer him; for I know, that if my faculties are right, and the common notions of humane reaſon are true, that I err not, and I will never deſire greater aſſurance, that I am in the right, then that my faculties are ſo; and if the Sceptick will rather reject all certainty, then acknowledge his faculties to be true, his fancy is ſo odd, that upon the ſame ſcore he may caſt himſelf from a precipice, becauſe its poſſible he might only dream that he was there.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Have not you your ſelf expreſly ſet down the difference of Proteſtant obedience from that of Papiſts unto the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church? whoſe words are theſe, which we find in the thirteenth phragraph of this Chapter: <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church repreſentative has an influence over the ſouls of men, requiring much more then an external ſubmiſſion, which yet is all that Proteſtants will allow to the moſt authentick General Councils.</hi> Now what a vaſt difference is there between giving external ſubmiſſion as we do, and internal aſſent to the truth of their decrees as you do?</p>

What impudence then is it to charge us as if we had changed the Pope for my Lord of <hi>Canterbury?</hi> and a General Council for a National Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? and the Conclave of <hi>Rome</hi> for a Parliament at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi> giving that very Authority to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that we take from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the difference

<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C. ſ.</hi> 6.</note> and the primitive Church, this is but a ſpecious pretence to varniſh over their Churches uſurpations; when they have placed all theſe with their own Church upon the bench, they ſignifie no more there then do the Ruſſian Emperours poor Senators at the ſolemn audience of forreign Ambaſſadours, that ſit only to make a ſhew. The ſame mockery do the Pontificians put upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they give them the name and title of judges, and yet deny them the office of judges, and this they do when they make their own Decrees our ultimate and ſupream rule and guide; for if Scripturr muſt bend to their Decrees, and not their decrees to Scripture, and if we muſt have no ſenſe of Scripture but what they think fit, then their Decrees and not Scripture muſt be our laſt rule; for that is the rule to which other things are reduced; if therefore from their Decrees we muſt receive the ſenſe of Scripture, which is Scripture it ſelf, then are they the ſupream ſtandard and rule of faith, and the ſole judges of it; As a judge if he have an unlimited power of interpreting the laws, would be both judge and law too. Thus when the Norman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107126:58"/>promiſed the Engliſh, that he would govern them by their own Laws, yet if he did (as ſome ſay he did) take an abſolute power of interpreting them, and allow them to ſay only what he pleaſed, could he be thought to ſatisfie his promiſe? might not all exclaim that his own will and tyranny, and not the laws ruled them, becauſe he ruled them after the ſame manner as he would, if there had been no ſuch laws, and ſo the laws were made uſeleſs, as if they had never been laws? Thus the Romaniſts may tell us, that they acknowledge Scripture to be in part our rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if their Church muſt have an unlimited power to interpret it, and put what ſenſe upon it they pleaſe, and that we muſt upon peril of Damnation receive their ſenſe, howſoever it ſeem to us abſurd and contradictory to the Scripture it ſelf, they need no more to ſhut out Scripture, and to make themſelves both ſole Lords and rules of our faith; its nothing for them to comply with Scripture, when they have forced that to comply with them. After the ſame manner Councils and Fathers, and all their venerable Antiquity (which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo much to reverence) muſt truckle to their preſent Church; for they will allow us to receive them no further then they agree with their own Decrees, ſeeing we muſt fetch the ſenſe of their writings from their Decrees; ſo that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Fathers, Councils, and all muſt bend to their wills, and can give no other judgement then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will permit, if we muſt (as they contend that we ought) receive their judgement from the judgement of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Tis a pretty device firſt to rule the rule, and then to be ruled by it. When therefore they talke of other guides and rules beſide their own pride and tyranny, their hypocriſie is ſo tranſparent through all its diſguiſes, that we cannot but diſcern it, unleſs we were as blind as they would have us; and laſtly as for our private reaſons, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will call them guides too; ſtrange he dare truſt himſelf with a guide ſo fallacious! but to avoid the danger of that, it muſt with humility follow the Church; a ſtrange guide that muſt be tamely guided and led in a ſtring by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! if the Church can command our reaſons, then muſt they neceſſarily ceaſe to be guides, and blindly follow her
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107126:58"/>whitherſoever ſhe leads. I wiſh they would make their Church but ſuch a guide, and then we ſhould ſoon agree in this point. If then to exclude reaſon from guiding us be to become beaſts (as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> teacheth us in the fifth Paragraph of this Chapter:) then what muſt all Romaniſts be? for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more plain, then that what is wholly guided by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not it ſelf a guide; otherwiſe every thing that is guided might be called a guide; therefore if your reaſons muſt follow the guidance of your Church, they cannot be your guides, and then in your own opinions what difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Catholik and his Aſſe?</p>
               <p>Now at length having made my way through this black Regiment of falſehoods,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> I may combate his great arguments (ſo carefully guarded with ſo long a train of fictions) for his Churches infallibility and our meek ſubmiſſion to it; but before I cope with them ſingly, its not impertinent to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine an Hypotheſis, on which they ſeem partly to ſtand, which ſtratagem might do me ſome ſervice, did I want it, that is, if his arguments were as ſtrong as they are weak, and that is this; He through the whole Chapter ſlily ſuppoſes, and ſometimes aſſerts, a neceſſity of an infallible judge, as if without ſuch a one the way to ſalvation were uncertain, and controverſies endleſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But he ſhould firſt prove, that God hath appointed an infallible judge, and therefore its neceſſary there ſhould be one, and not conclude that he hath appointed one, becauſe he conceives a neceſſity of it. I could name an hundred priviledges, that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> could conceive to be highly benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Church, which yet God never granted to it; and if we may deduce infallibility from the neceſſity or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of it to ſecure us in our way to Heaven, and decide our controverſies, then why may we not conclude, that ſome body elſe beſide your Pope and Council is infallible? Is it not more conducive to theſe ends, that every Biſhop ſhould be infallible? more ſtill, that every Preacher? and more yet, that every individual Chriſtian? would not theſe infallibly ſecure them from all danger of erring? Might not God ſend ſome infallible interpreter from heaven, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound all obſcure and doubtful places of Scripture? might
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107126:59"/>not the Apoſtles have left us ſuch a Commentary? might not God (if he had pleaſed) have ſpoken ſo perſpicuouſly in Scripture, that there ſhould be no need of an infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter to make it plainer? but if from the advantage and uſe of theſe diſpenſations we ſhould infer their actual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, the concluſion would confute the Premiſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The plea for an infallible guide, to ſecure us from wandring out of the way to heaven, is invalidated by the plainneſs and eaſineſs of the way, which we cannot miſs unleſs we will; ſo that he who will keep his eyes open, is in no more danger of loſing his way, then in the walks of his own garden; for we know the conditions which God hath made neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are clear and eaſie, unleſs God ſhould bind us upon pain of damnation fully to know and believe Articles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and ambiguous, and ſo damn men for not believing that the truth whereof they could not diſcover, which is highly repugnant both to his revealed goodneſs and juſtice. We therefore diſtinguiſh between points fundamental and not ſundamental, thoſe being clearly revealed, and ſo of a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary belief; to determine their ſenſe, there is no more need of a judge, then for any other perſpicious truth. What need of a judge to decide whether Scripture affirms that there is but one God? that this God cannot lye? that Jeſus Chriſt was ſent by his commiſſion into the world? that he was crucified and roſe again? that without faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we cannot come to heaven? theſe, and ſuch like, are the truths we entitle Fundamental; and if the ſenſe of theſe need an infallible judge, then lets bring <hi>Euclids</hi> Elements to the barr, and call for a judge to decide whether twice two make four. Then for points not fundamental, their belief being not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, we may err about them, and not err damnably, and ſo this plea for an infallible judge is wholly evacuated. And with no more difficulty may we baffle the other, taken from its neceſſity to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine controverſies; for if any man oppoſe fundamental doctrines, or any other evident truths, our Church can cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, without pretending to be infallible; what need of an infallible judge to convict him of hereſie, that ſhall deny the reſurrection of the dead? (which yet ſome of your
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107126:59"/>own Popes have not believed, if ſome of your own Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may be believed) Then for Doctrines not fundamental, being not clearly revealed, our Church doth not take upon her to determine theſe, but if any diſputes ariſe about ſuch points, its her work to ſilence and ſuppreſs them, and when ſhe gives her judgement of that ſide ſhe thinks moſt probable, though ſhe doth not expect that all her children ſhould be ſo wiſe as to be of her opinion, yet ſhe expects they ſhould be ſo modeſt, as not to contradict her, which is as effectually available to end controverſies as is your pretended infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>Now my next work muſt be to conſider his arguments for their Churches infallibility, and our ſubmiſſion to it,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> where I cannot but requeſt the Reader ſeriouſly to conſider, upon what little arguings, what pittiful ſophiſms, what ſtrawy pillars ſtands not only the great and magnificent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Papal Infallibility and Authority, but alſo their whole faith, religion, and eternal ſalvation; ſeeing they make them all to ſtand upon the ſame foundations, on which ſtands their Churches Infallibility, ſo that when their weakneſs is diſcovered, all muſt unavoidably fall. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed then;</p>
               <p>His argument why we muſt ſtand to the Churches deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under pain of damnation, is, becauſe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, 9, 10. God commanded the Iſraelites in all quarrels to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Prieſts and Levites and ſtand to their ſentence, and enacted that the man who would do preſumptuouſly, and would not hearken to the Prieſt, ſhould be put to death.</p>
               <p>To paſs by many other exceptions that might be made againſt this Argument, only take notice,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Appeal was from the leſſer Conſiſtories to the great Sanhedrin, only in civil and private quarrels, as is evident by the eighth verſe, <hi>If there ariſe a matter too hard for thee in judgement between blood and blood, between plea and plea, between ſtroke and ſtroke, being matters of controverſie, within thy gates,</hi> &amp;c. Now becauſe theſe words ſo plainly import private injuries and Law ſuits, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> jumps from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107126:60"/>them and cites 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8. where this is not ſo plain, though plain enough too. Now what to his purpoſe can follow hence, unleſs he will make out this conſequence, We muſt ſubmit to the deciſions of the Magiſtrate in all our conteſts and brawls, and therefore we muſt aſſent to all the determinations of the Church as true and infallible! But theſe proportions are at ſuch a wide diſtance from each other, that I doubt he will never be able to fit himſelf with a <hi>medius terminus</hi> large enough to couple them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What more can be deduced hence, then that we are bound to ſubmit to the ſentence of ſuperiours? and this what Proteſtant denies? do not we plead for it as well as you? but what like an Inference can be drawn from this, for an internal ſubmiſſion of judgement? Nothing at all, till he can make good, that we cannot ſubmit to the ſentence of our judges, unleſs we believe them juſt and true. An aſſertion ridiculouſly falſe. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. You tell us, that in this obedience was implyed an aſſent or ſubmiſſion of judgement; but how Sir will you prove this? I dare not take your bare word for it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your ſolemn proteſtation at the begining of your book.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> And then a little after you affirm that its poſſible thoſe very judges might give a wrong ſentence. If ſo, then was it poſſible for God upon pain of death to require us to believe a falſehood; for it was poſſible (you ſay) they ſhould give wrong ſentence, and yet you will have them upon pain of death to believe it right. But</p>
               <p n="4">4. You tell us, that this aſſent and ſubmiſſion of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be given; otherwiſe the obedience would be againſt conſcience, in caſe the party continued in a contrary opinion of the ſenſe of the Law. But we can not ſubmit to the judges ſentence without hypocriſie, unleſs we aſſent to its equity? ſuppoſe they ſhould miſtake (as you ſay they might) the innocent for the injurious, muſt the party think himſelf a knave becauſe they think ſo, like the poor fellow that though he ſaw the Prieſt lye with his wife, yet
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107126:60"/>did penance for ſaying ſo, and was forced to ſay, Tongue thou lyeſt. This is ſuch an aſſertion, that I believe never yet any Caſuiſt dreamt of. When we appeal to judges, our meaning is not we will think as they think, but we will ſubmiſſively acquieſce as they ſhall determine. Again, tis ſtill more ſtrange, that when falſe judgement is given, the contending party muſt either believe a lye, or muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front his conſcience in not believing it; for if he aſſents not to the equity of the deciſions, he goes (ſay you) againſt his Conſcience; and if he doth, he muſt believe againſt the truth, when he believes that to be the ſenſe of the law which is not.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> Next follow his arguments for his Churches infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; The firſt runs thus: Our Saviour hath promiſed his Apoſtles, that he would be preſent with them always to the end of the world: therefore fince not any of them outlived that age, this infallible promiſe muſt be made good to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I might perhaps tell you, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we tranſlate the end of the world, refers to the end of the Jewiſh ſtate, and ſo ſignifies only the end of that age; as frequently in ſcripture this very phraſe ſignifies only ſome great period of time; Now if this ſenſe be taken, as no reaſon but it may, then did this promiſe dye with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſo could not be entaild on their ſucceſſours. But becauſe I will not be too rigid with him, it ſhall be The end of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> from this and the other enſuing arguments, endeavours to evince the Infallibility of the Roman Church, which by reaſon of their impertinence the Reader may have need to be minded of it, and then its pleaſant to behold the wide Chaſme between his premiſes and concluſions, and the large leaps he is forced to make from them to theſe. Chriſt hath promiſed to be with his Apoſtles to the end of the world, <hi>ergo</hi> the Roman Church is infallible. Well leapt! Is it poſſble you ſhould erect your infallibility upon ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, were you not firſt reſolved to be infallible, and then catch at any thing to prove it? For here is not one ſyllable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107126:61"/>of infallibility, and then why may not any other priviledge be promiſed here as well as that? I will be with you to the end of the world, that is, ſay you, I will ſecure you from all errour; and why not as well, I will exempt you from all ſin, or from all perſecutions? are not theſe as expreſs in the promiſe as infallibility? and yet no body was ever yet ſo fooliſh as to argue hence that the Church is free from all ſin, and not lyable to any perſecutions. Again could not Chriſt be with them, unleſs he endowed them with infallibility? Is there no other way for him to be with his ſervants, unleſs by inſpiring them with that? Is not his ſpirit with every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular believer as well as with the Church! and muſt all Chriſtians be therefore infallible? If, in a word, wherever Chriſt is preſent by his ſpirit, there is no errour, then is every individual Chriſtian infallible, and then what need of any other infallible guide? but if where Chriſt is preſent by his ſpirit, there may be errour, then how groſs is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed to be with his Church by his ſpirit, that therefore he exempts it from all errour?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This argument fights alike for every cauſe, and may be liſted for the ſervice of all pretenders. What if the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould arrogate infallibility? would it not ſerve our turns as much as yours? What if the Greek Church ſhould urge it for themſelves, how would you anſwer them? Is not this conſequence, <hi>Chriſt hath promiſed to be with his Church to the end of the world, ergo</hi> The Greek Church is infallible, as good as yours? that becauſe our Saviour hath made ſuch a promiſe, <hi>ergo</hi> the Roman Church is infallible? What diſparity can you give, unleſs you firſt ſuppoſe whats to be proved! And then what anſwer you would give to them, the ſame give to your ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> 2. His ſecond Argument runs thus. Chriſt hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that when two or three of them meet together in his name, he will be in the midſt of them; ſurely to direct them; therefore much more when the whole Church is repreſentatively aſſembled about his buſineſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:107126:61"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument is far more frivolous (if that can be) then the former. Is Infallibility promiſed here, or is it not? if not, then this Text is nothing to the purpoſe; if it be, then 1. Whereever two or three Chriſtians meet together in Chriſts Name they are infallible, and then what need of General Councils, ſeeing two or three honeſt men can as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly decide all controverſies? Mr. <hi>C.</hi> muſt own this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, if his own is good; ſeeing therefore this is falſe, his can not be true. 2. Doth not this Argument furniſh every Conventicle with a pretence to infallibility as much as your Church? Doth it not as much juſtifie all the Doctrines vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Bull and Mouth, as the Canons of the <hi>Trent</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? Suppoſe a Quaker there ſhould urge this Argument for the truth of all their Doctrines, how would you Anſwer him? fancy what Reply you pleaſe, and thats the very ſame we give you. How ſtrange is it that ever men ſhould damn one another for not believing the validity of ſuch ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly abſurd deductions!</p>

                  <hi>Ar.</hi> 3.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> He hath promiſed that he will lead his Church into all truth, at leaſt all that is neceſſary or but expedient for them to know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now he ſeems to miſgive, and a little to mince the matter: that the Church ſhall be led into all neceſſary truths we aſſert; what need of his running to that? either he would here prove the Church infallible in all things, or not; if the latter, then he either gives up the cauſe, or beats beſide the Queſtion; but if the former, then let him ſpeak out, and let us ſee how ſound his proof is. Where then hath Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to lead his Church into all truth? he knows there is no ſuch promiſe in all the Bible, and therefore ſets down no particular Text, as he is wont to do in his other proofs. Such a promiſe indeed Chriſt made to his Apoſtles, That he would ſend them his Spirit, that ſhould guide them into all truth,
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note> and ſhew them things to come, which we find fulfilled, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. But how can we prove that this promiſe appertains to any beſides the Apoſtles? or if to any, why to the Roman Church more than to the Greeks, the Abaſſines, the Georgians, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Sure that Argument can not be faithful to you, that is as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107126:62"/>ſtrong for your adverſaries as for your ſelves. <hi>Ob.</hi> But you are the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles and not they; <hi>A.</hi> But the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of it is, that this is the very thing to be proved. Beſide Chriſt here promiſeth the power of Prophecying; but I hope the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not undertake to foretell-things future (and though ſhe did, the event would ſoon confute her infallibility) and therefore this promiſe belongs not to her. Its a pretty inference, that becauſe the Apoſtles were infallible, that therefore the Churches in all ages muſt be ſo; But prettier ſtill, that therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Church particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly muſt be ſo.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As if he were not abſurd enough in his former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings, he muſt now be impertinent too; what is it to the purpoſe to prove that God will preſerve his Church from being overcome with Hereſies? which we grant; his task (if to the purpoſe) is to prove, That God will preſerve his Church from all manner of erring. But what if Hereſie ſhall not prevail againſt the true Church? doth it follow that it ſhall not prevail againſt any particular Church? the Greek Church was once a true Church in your eſteem, but now you ſay tis poiſoned and deſtroyed by Hereſie. If then this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made to no particular Church, why muſt it be ſo applyed to your own particular Church? Before you uſe this Argument to any purpoſe, firſt prove yours to be the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church; but of this you preſume; its a ſad ſymptome of the weakneſs of your cauſe, when you build it upon beg'd and ungranted preſumptions, and ſtill ſuppoſe your moſt difficult and material diſpute to be granted.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> ſhall be (cut off from his body) as an Heathen and a Publican; therefore <hi>Anathemas</hi> pronounced by his Church are valid. Our Lord indeed ſpeaks of deciſions made by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church in quarrels among Brethren; therefore if diſobedience to ſuch deciſions be ſo grievouſly puniſhed,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107126:62"/>what puniſhment may we ſuppoſe attends ſuch as are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the deciſions of the Univerſal Church, (called by the Apoſtles the pillar and ground of truth) made for the compoſing of publick debates about the common faith?</p>

               <p n="2">2. Whats this to Infallibility? will he infer that particular Churches are infallible, becauſe their Deciſions muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to? if he will, then he proves what himſelf will deny, and conſtitutes us infallible Judges at home, without recourſe to Oecumenical Councils; but if he doth not, then how enormous is his deduction? becauſe the Deciſions of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, which are granted to be fallible, muſt be obeyed, therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Saviour enjoyned them obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Scribes and Phariſees, are they infallible too? children are commanded, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. to be ſubject to their Parents in all things, are all Fathers too therefore infallible? we muſt obey the commands of Kings and Princes, cannot they err neither? and is not the inference as concluding, We are bound to obey Parents and Governours, <hi>ergo</hi> they are infallible; as becauſe we are bound to obey the Church, therefore that is infallible?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The judgement of the Church that muſt here be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, is about quarrels and injuries among Brethren; but doth it follow, that becauſe the Church may be Judge of our quarrels, that it may be Judge of our faith too? if it do, we will have all decided by our Judges of Aſſize, without going to <hi>Rome:</hi> its time now you ſhould have learn'd the difference of ſubmitting to the determinations of Judges

But ſhould we believe ſuch an unity in the Church as that it ſhould have no diverſity of opinions, (as you would perſwade us) we muſt believe againſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for unleſs we will unchurch all parties but our own, (which would be a moſt uncharitable preſumption) we muſt acknowledge a diverſity of opinions in the true Church, and ſo not make unity of judgement in the Church an Article of faith.

Urge us not then with this Argument any more, till you can prove, that we believe any other unity in the Church, beſide an unity and agreement in the Chriſtian faith, and that you are any more then ſo one among your ſelves.

If (ſay you) the Doctor applyes theſe promiſes to his own, and not to the Catholick Church, then doth he condemn St. <hi>Gregory</hi> that profeſſed he venerated the four firſt General Councils (<hi>ergo</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church againſt which the Doctor diſputes) as the four Goſpels; but the Doctor doth allow them to the Catholick, and ſo no fear of quarrelling with St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in their own account; yea he will not fear to grant with the Reverend Archbiſhop, that they are <hi>de poſt facto</hi> (that is being received by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church diffuſed) infallible, as to the matters of faith determined by them; and yet this ſequel ſeems ſomewhat harſh, I venerate the four firſt General Councils as the four Goſpels; <hi>ergo</hi> the promiſes cited by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> belong to the <hi>(Roman)</hi> Catholick Church in all ages; an inference ſo entirely abſurd, and weak, that tis a ſhame to inſult over it; nor will the profeſſion of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> any thing avail to prove the infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but at the moſt of a General Council only; albeit I cannot ſee but that it may fairly admit of another ſenſe; for ſpeaking of the Paſchal Feaſt, which the Council had decreed ſhould be kept unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, he calls it a Divine command, and gives this reaſon, becauſe whatever is decreed in the Councils of Biſhops, <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Not words but things are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our faith; therefore the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing new words is no mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of new Articles; but if you will aſsert that under thoſe new expreſſions were couched new Articles too, upon this ſuppoſition it would be no ill manners to reprove their preſumption.</note> either by others or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and thence it is apparent, that we are not preſently to yeild up our aſſent to propoſals, becauſe attended with theſe Anathema's, ſeeing by ſo doing we may aſſent to an untruth, and be obliged to believe the contrary to what Scripture hath revealed: nor can I imagine, to what end you ſhould inform us of new expreſſions in theſe General Councils, as <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. We ſhall tell him, in the ſequel of the Chapter, That theſe prayers of the Fathers depended partly upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions exploded by the Romaniſt himſelf, partly upon other things, which cannot ſuppoſe a Purgatory in the mild'ſt ſence.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> But is it true that the Romaniſt's Purgatory is onely a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107126:71"/>place wherein ſouls are capable of receiving help or eaſe by prayers, why then may it not be Heaven? for the ſouls there may be help't to a fuller ſtate of Glory by our prayers, as the Fathers generally affirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. The <hi>Trent</hi> Council tells us that the Catholick Church out of Scripture, and the ancient Tradition of the Fathers, and the holy Councils, hath taught us that there is a Purgatory, and thereupon commands the Biſhops to be diligent that the ſound Doctrine of Purgatory taught by the Fathers and Councils ſhould be believed, held, and every where prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ask, whether the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Thus <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. That there is ſome fire in Purgatory, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from theſe words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. He ſhall, &amp;c. So alſo from the Teſtimony of the Fathers eited in the firſt Book, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally call the puniſhment of Purgatory fire, and this he puts among the thing in which all agree.</note> upon which eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they build their Purgatory, be not ſuch as theſe: <hi>They ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire; ſome ſins are forgiven in this world, ſome in the world to come?</hi> And as for the Tradition of the Fathers, is not the purging fire they ſpeak of moſt inſiſted on? And do not many of the places cited by our Author ſpeak of the pardon of their ſins? Well then, if this was the Doctrine confirmed by Scripture, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tradition of the Fathers, then muſt Purgatory needs be a place of fire wherein the ſouls are tormented, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing analogous thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt needs follow, that Purgatory is a place where ſouls be impriſoned till they have ſatisfied for their ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it not the common Doctrine that ſounds almoſt in every Pulpit, that Purgatory is a place under the Earth, in the lower regions of it, wherein ſome ſouls departed are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly tormented, and where they are to continue till they have ſatisfied Gods Juſtice for ſome venial ſins, unleſs they can be helpt out ſooner by the prayers of the living, ſacrifice of the Maſs indulgences of the Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let Maſter <hi>Creſſy</hi> ſpeak his Conſcience, whether this be not the Doctrine moſt frequently taught in their writings, and in their Sermons <hi>ad populum:</hi> And being ſo, I ask him whether it be the <hi>ſana doctrina</hi> the <hi>Trent</hi> Council ſpeaks of: If it be not, then are all their Biſhops diſobedient to this Council which charges them to look to it generally that the ſound Doctrine be taught: And if ſo, either this diſobedience is wilful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their knowledge, and ſo they live continually in a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107126:72"/>wilful ſin; or from ignorance of the true Doctrine of the Church; and then muſt our Author ſay, that he knows the Doctrine of the Church better then all theſe Biſhops. If it be, then is the Doctrine which we commonly oppoſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, are theſe things tending to Edification, or not? if not, then are all the Biſhops in fault for ſuffering them to be taught, contrary to the Council: If they be, then I hope they are the ſound Doctrine of Purgatory The <hi>Trent</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">De Puigatorio.</note> Their <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will tell us, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. That Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory is in a place nigh unto the damned, and prove it from the ſecond of the <hi>Acts, ſolutis doloribus inferni,</hi> the pains of Hell being looſed, which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (ſaith he) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands of Purgatory: and that hence it is, that the Church in the Maſs for the Dead ſaith,
<note place="margin">Deliver the Souls departed from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of Hell, and the deep Lake:</note> 
                  <hi>Libera animas defunctorum de paenis inferni, &amp; de profundo lacu.</hi> Yea, ſecondly, He will tell you from the venerable <hi>Beda,</hi> That this was confirmed by a Viſion wherein Purgatory was ſeen next to Hell: And thirdly, that <hi>omnes fere Theologi,</hi> almoſt all their Divines aſſert, that the ſouls in Purgatory are in the ſame place, and tormented with the ſame fire as the damned are. Well then, firſt if the Maſs prayes that the ſouls in Purgatory may be deliverd from the puniſhment <hi>infernal, &amp; de profundo lacu,</hi> then muſt they be ſuppoſed to be in ſome infernal place; if almoſt all the Divines teach this place to be the ſame with that in which the damned are tormented, then muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Divines be guilty of contradicting the Decree of the Synod of <hi>Trent,</hi> all the Biſhops be negligent of the charge there given, or elſe this which they teach muſt be the <hi>ſana Doctrina</hi> which it required to be held.
<note place="margin">Seſſ. ult. doc. de Purg.</note> Again, I ſuppoſe, your <hi>Trent</hi> Council when it ſpeaks of holy Councils defining Purgatory, excludes not the <hi>Florentine</hi> which thus defines it; <hi>That if true penitents depart in the love of God, before they have ſatisfied for their ſins of Omiſſion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by fruits of repentance, their ſouls go to Purgatory to be purg'd:</hi> and the Indulgencies which the Pope gives ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to theſe poor ſouls are nothing elſe but the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, or his Saints to the dead.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107126:72"/>So then out of theſe things ſo deduced, we have all that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we charge you with.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there are ſome ſins venial, ſuch as if God ſhould deal with men in rigour deſerve onely a temporal puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That you hold, that albeit the ſin may be pardoned and remitted, yet there may be a guilt of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be endured for it. This is clear from the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and theſe two <hi>Bellarmine</hi> joyns together;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Purg. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The true and Catholick opinion is, that Purgatory is a place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for thoſe that die with ſome venial ſins, which are the hay and ſtubble mentioned,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. and again, <hi>for thoſe that depart with the guilt of puniſhment, the fault being formerly remitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That you ſay the ſouls of many that die in the Lord go into Purgatory, to ſatisfie for theſe venial ſins, or to undergo the Temporal puniſhments due to theſe ſins whoſe fault is pardoned.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That this Purgatory whither they go is a place of puniſhment next to Hell, and that there they are tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſame torments which the damned ſuffer, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may differ for Degree and Space. Now theſe are things which all your skill ſhall never be able to deduce from prayers as they were uſed by the ancients for the dead.

               <p>And firſt, whereas you ſay,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Satisfac. page</hi> 452.</note> theſe prayers for the dead have confeſſed Apoſtolical antiquity to plead for them; here <hi>Dally</hi> telling you, <hi>That of the cuſtome of praying for the Dead,</hi> Juſtine <hi>and</hi> Irenaeus <hi>who flouriſhed in the ſecond Age, do make no mention;</hi> ſo that it is credible it came in after that Age, for Cauſes we ſhall hereafter mention.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> 
               </p>
               <p>But to paſs on to your proofs,
<note place="margin">p. 112. Sect. 6.</note> you tell us <hi>That the Author of the Book fathered on Saint</hi> Denis <hi>the Areopagite, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Proteſtants, lived within the ſecond Century after the Apoſtles,</hi> when as even Biſhop <hi>Forbs,</hi> upon the Queſtion, tells you that he lived in the third or rather the fourth Century; and it is clear that he ſpeaks of Monks, which had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till the third Century of Temples, and Altars, which <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> who flouriſhed in the third Century, have told us the Chriſtians never had. And therefore
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107126:73"/>whereas he ſayes, that what he teacheth he had from the Apoſtles, his Divine Teachers, this lye can ſure avail you nothing, but to evidence how willing cheats are to put off their ware at the beſt hand. But as he is, let us hear him telling us what the Prieſts demand from God, <hi>for the perſon departed,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſt. c.</hi> 7.</note> a pardon of all fins committed by him through humane frailty, and that he may be conducted into</hi> Abrahams <hi>boſome, into a place from which grief, ſadneſs and mourning, was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed:</hi> But that this place of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> makes nothing for Purgatory, appears, firſt, in that the party is deſcribed by him to have departed out of this life repleniſhed with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine joy, as now not fearing any change to worſe, being come to the end of all his labour, and to have been both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately acknowledged by his friends, and publickly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Miniſters of the Church to be a happy man,
<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Fern</hi> againſt <hi>Spencer, C. de Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio.</hi>
                  </note> and to be verily admitted into the ſociety of the <hi>Saints that have been from the beginning of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, in that the Biſhop or Prieſt, ſo praying, is ſaid by him to be the Interpreter or publiſher of the Divine Judgements;</q> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> in giving rewards according as men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: And how that the Divine loving kindneſs, in great goodneſs, over-looks their infirmities, or ſpots and ſtains of ſin contracted by humane weakneſs. Thus that prayer which begs the full forgiveneſs of his ſins is doctrine to the living, ſhewing and aſſuring them of Gods mercy to them that ſtrive to live well; notwithſtanding through humane weakneſs they offend often, and cannot be free from all ſpots and ſtains of ſin. Then in relation, as it ſeems, to the other part of the prayer which begg'd, that he might be placed in light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Author adds: The Biſhop or Prieſt knows ſuch good things are promiſed, and therefore prayes that they may come to paſs and be given to them that have lived well. Alſo he knows that the good things promiſed will come to paſs; and therefore as the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gods Will, he ſhews that they will ſurely be made good to them that ſo live and die; and if theſe be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this prayer, ſurely they will not conclude a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Well then; when he prayes for the pardon of his fin, he refers to that ſecond ſentence of the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107126:73"/>that God would then proclaim him pardoned, and then would receive him into heaven,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 7.</note> both as to body and ſoul: And hence our <hi>Dionyſius</hi> tels us, that in theſe Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities the Church was wont to read the undoubted promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which were recorded touching the reſurrection; and then devoutly ſang Pſalms of the ſame Argument: As you may ſee in Biſhop <hi>

               <p>Secondly, as for that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 116. <hi>p.</hi> 516.</note> he hath Tranſlated it, that no Oblation ſhall be made for him; <hi>viz.</hi> That names in his Will for an Executor an Eccleſiaſtical perſon, The Latine hath it <hi>pre Dormitione ejus:</hi> (and as <hi>Dally</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers his <hi>Bellarm.</hi>) refers to the Euchariſtical thankſgivings, which they offered <hi>ob Dormitionem ejus,</hi> that the faithful ſoul was delivered from the evils of the world; which he confirms from the teſtimony of the Author of the Commentary on <hi>Job,</hi> commonly aſcribed to <hi>Origen;</hi> And from Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> who tells us, <hi>Diem quo obierint (ſancti ſc.)

               <p>The firſt Teſtimony which he borrows from <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> tell us only this, <hi>That according to the Apoſtles Inſtitution,

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:107126:74"/>
               <p>Secondly, That this was done that ſome comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment might accrue to them thereby. Now that the firſt comes not up to a ſhew of any proof for Purgatory, is evident to any eye but blur'd with prejudice, as appears from thoſe many other ends, for which the Fathers eſteemed it uſeful; as to bring and keep their ſouls in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſome,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Dally, de Satisfac. l</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> to procure them a portion in the millenary reignhere on earth, an augmentation of their Glory, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Reſurrection of their bodles, an abatement or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the flames of the laſt day, and the rigour of the laſt judgment.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſecond,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hom. Cor. in c.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 46.</note> S. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> might well ſay, that 'twas not in vain to pray for ſinners, when he held that thereby the torments of the greateſt ſinners were or might be alleviated, as appeares from his, 21. Hom. on the Acts of the Apoſtles, where ſpeaking of a man <hi>who had not lived one day to himſelf, but to Voluptuouſneſs, Intemperance, Covetouſneſs, to ſin, and the Devil; if he chance to die</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall we not mourn for him? ſhall we not endeavour to pull him out of theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? For there be waies, if we will, whereby his puniſhment may be made light for him: If then we do continually make prayers for him, if we beſtow Almes, though he be unworthy, God will reſpect us:</hi> And whereas he adds, that it was the practice of the Church, we grant it; but the Church then practiſed it for the ends now ſpecified, not becauſe ſhe believed the <hi>Roman</hi> Purgatory. For that Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> thought that the parties deceaſt if they had lived well were in a ſtate of Joy, and not of Grief, appears by the funeral Ordinances of the Church related by him, which were appointed to admoniſh the living of it.

Now then, ſeeing 'tis as clear as the Sun, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thought them both in Heaven, or in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, (<hi>viz.</hi> The Emperours, <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi>) is it poſſible he ſhould pray for their deliverance out of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory? what good could they need beſides that which he prays for, a ſpeedy reſurrection, who already enjoyed the pleaſures of Eternal life? If Eternal life be purgatory, I will not give

                  </note> the outmoſt that can be gathered from it is, that in Saint <hi>Auſtin's</hi> and the Churches judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was not to be doubted that our Brethren were helped by theſe prayers, ſo that God might deal with them more mercifully then their ſins deſerved, and that prayers and offerings were made for them, out of an intention of commending them to Gods mercy; and what of all this? For (1.) Doth not the ſame <hi>Auſtine</hi> pray, that God would deal more mercifully with his mother then her ſins deſerv'd? did he not commend her to Gods mercy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he verily thought ſhe was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome? (2.)

Well then, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their brethren to Gods mercy, as knowing that they deſerved theſe puniſhments, from which they could not be otherwiſe delivered then by the clemency and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God; which is very true, and yet makes not at all for purgatory; and indeed their prayers for pardon of ſins was only thus, that God would at the laſt day proclaim them pardon'd, and would not caſt them into Hell with the damned, but receive them into glory; which prayers the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day makes for all the faithfull.</p>

If in Hell, would it not be impious, (Oh impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Origen. Greg.

               <p>And thus having gone over our Adverſaries teſtimonies in Defence of Pugatory, we ſhall now add, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> a few Arguments againſt it. And firſt, if there be no ſuch puniſhments as the Papiſts do imagine ſuffer'd by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full after this Life, then are not their Souls in Purgatory; but there is no ſuch puniſhment of the faithful after this Life: And firſt, were there any ſuch puniſhments of the faithful after this Life, how wonderful is it that no Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be given in againſt them! There is not any evil that can befall us here, but the Scripture hath afforded us ſome Conſolation againſt it; But though the puniſhments in Purgatory be more grievous, by their own confeſſion; then any we can ſuffer here, yet have we not one word of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation againſt them. Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> tells <hi>Dives that he had receiv'd his good things in this Life, and Lazarus his evil; and now he is comforted and thou tormented;</hi> what is this comfort, but his being carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome? When was he carried thither? when he dyed, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. <hi>The beggar died and was carried</hi> (not into Purgatory, but) <hi>into Abrahams boſome: The rich man dyed alſo and was buried.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, none will deny that the rich man was buried preſently after his death, and then why ſhould they deny that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome ſoon after his death; And if <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome were Purgatory, (I cannot ſay he had cold, but) I'me ſure he had but ſmall comfort of being there; But be it ſo, that he was not in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, yet he had receiv'd his evil things in this Life, ſaith Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> which with what truth could he have ſo ſaid, had he been to receive ſo great and ſo long puniſhments when his life was ended?</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing this beggar had no prae-eminence over other beggars, that are ſuppoſed to live piouſly as this <hi>Lazarus</hi> did, or above other of the Saints of God, if he eſcaped Purgatory, and was immediately receiv'd into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, why may not they? Thirdly, The evils which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107126:78"/>the faithful ſuffer, they ſuffer in the time of their peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and abſence from their Fathers houſe; but that is terminated and defined by our being in the body; thus <hi>Peter Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. calls it the time of our ſojourning, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the time of our being from home, the time of our being in this world, ſaith <hi>Eſtius;</hi> And again; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Dum ſumus in corpore peregrinamur à Deo? And when we are abſent from the body we are preſent with the Lord;</hi> therefore we are not abſent from the Lord: when we are in Purgatory we are abſent from the Lord; <hi>Ergo,</hi> when we are abſent from the body we are not in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Argument ſhall be this; They that go to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, Paradiſe, or an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, do not go to Purgatory at the ſame time; but the faithful preſently after death go to the fore-mentioned places, or ſome of them; Becauſe they go to them when their earthly Tabernacle is diſſolved, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know that if our earthly tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Now this implies that as ſoon as we are diſpoſſeſs'd of one of theſe houſes we go to the other; or elſe the comfort would be but cold, and the oration not worthy of God, but deluſory. For put the Caſe, I ſhould tell my friend, I ſee thy houſe is going to ruine; But care not for it, I have a better for you to betake your ſelf to, when that fails: If he ſhould come to me a while after for this houſe, and I tell him, true, I have an houſe for him, but he muſt be content to lie firſt ten or twenty years in the ſtreet, and after that he ſhall go into it; would not my friend think, I had dealt very deceitfully with him, having given him ground to hope that preſently after the fall of his houſe he ſhould have another? So God here tells us, well Chriſtians, if your houſe once fall, your body be diſſolved, be not troubled, you ſhall have an houſe in heaven; when their body is diſſolv'd, they come expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an houſe in heaven, pleading his promiſe; ſhould God ſay, true, you ſhall have an houſe in Heaven, but you muſt burn In purgatory firſt for a 100. yeers or two: would he not ſeem to mock us? (2.) The houſe is ſaid to be had, when our
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107126:78"/>earthly body is diſſolved: now this is either becauſe we are then preſently to enjoy it, &amp; then down falls purgatory; or elſe, becauſe after a hundred years in purgatory we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it: If ſo, why may we not be ſaid to have it before this houſe is diſſolv'd, ſeeing by our good works, Martyrdom, indulgence, procured, we may make our purgatory the ſhorter while we live here? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> Anſwers; true, we ſhall go to heaven preſently, but only we that are cloathed, that is, endued with excellent vertues, and merits, and have perfected our repentance. But the reſt that are naked ſhall be ſaved ſo as by fire. But (1.) The Apoſtle ſaith, they alone ſhall have the heavenly houſe who are cloath'd, that being the condition; yea this is the condition of their groaning to be diſſolved, which (ſaith he) we would not do were we to be found naked; and yet they that were in this tabernacle did groan, therefore none of them would be found naked. (2.) Thoſe that go to Heaven are cloathed upon; But thoſe that go naked to purgatory cannot be ſo; For ſeeing to be cloathed is to be adorn'd with more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degrees of virtue, and they themſelves acknowledge that in purgatory there is no place for the encreaſe of virtue, there is no probability of being cloathed upon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot be ſuppoſed to go to purgatory naked, ſince they that go thither are ſure afterward to go to heaven. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. the Apoſtle tells us, that whileſt we are at home in the body we are abſent from the Lord, and that, Here the faithful deſire to be abſent from the body, becauſe it hinders them from the preſence of the Lord, and walking by ſight; now had they been acquainted with purgatory, ſurely they would have expreſs'd their deſires of being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from that alſo, ſeeing that was like not only to be more irkſome to them, but alſo more durable, and therefore a greater impediment; ſince therefore they groan'd ſo much to be deliver'd from a ſhort life here, which hinders their enjoyment of Gods preſence, and not at all for deliverance from a hundred or two hundred years continuance in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, (for ſo long, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the Church hath pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Souls in purgatory) we infer, they were not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. Again, they that are to be receiv'd into Eternal
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107126:79"/>habitations when their life fails them, are to be received at death, for then they fail: But ſo are charitable men, (and by parity of Reaſon other pious ſouls.) The minor is proved from <hi>Luke</hi> 16. v. 8. <hi>Make unto your ſelves friends of the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> that is uſe it ſo, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that when you fail, <hi>i. e.</hi> dy, they may receive you, that is, may procure you a reception, or rather (as Doctor <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>) you may be received into everlaſting habitations.</p>
               <p>But our Author hath his arguments alſo,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> which come now to be conſidered: And firſt, he tells us of an expreſs teſtimony for Purgatory in the Book of <hi>Macchabees:</hi> Now not to call upon him for an Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> of the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as knowing how impoſſible it is to be done; albeit it be neceſſary to make this Teſtimony a Cogent proof, ſeeing he onely tells us that there is ſuch a place in the Book of <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees:</hi> I will add where the words may be found, even in <hi>Dally,</hi> page 439. where they are fully conſidered, and it made evidently to appear that they come not up to a proof of Purgatory; neither are they conſiſtent with the received Maxims of the abettors thereof: and whereas our adverſary calls in the Univerſal Tradition, and practice of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Jews to juſtifie this place, the ſame worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath made it evident, that neither this nor any other Teſtimony produced by them is any tolerable proof of ſuch practice:
<note place="margin">p. 449. 450.</note> Nay he evinceth moſt clearly from this paſſage that this practice was not received in our Saviour's, or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time; <hi>Ne apud infimos &amp; corruptos Judaeos:</hi> yea, he ſpends the 14. Chapter of his ſecond Book, to evidence that the Jewes were ignorant of Prayers for the dead; and ſhould we after all this give any credit to your confident aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of ſuch evident untruths? It concerns you, if you reſpect your credit to anſwer what is extant in the forecited places of the Learned <hi>Dally,</hi> and to evince this univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and practice you here ſpeak of without the leaſt offer of any proof, unleſs what follows muſt be ſo eſteem'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that from the Jewes no doubt <hi>Plato</hi> borrowed this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and from <hi>Plato Cicero:</hi> But I pray you, Sir, permit us (who have the Arguments fore-mentioned to evidence that in our Saviours time, the Jewes had no ſuch

                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Creſſie, p.</hi> 124.</note> and miſtakes, as (1.) that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is as old as the firſt general Council, whereas it was never uſed by any Father, or at leaſt never applied unto this matter, for the ſpace of a thouſand years and upwards; nor can I find any of their own writers, beſides himſelf, that ever pleaded the uſe of ſuch a word. (2.) Another miſtake is, <hi>that the Church onely ſaith, the change made in the holy Sacrament is uſually called Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> when the <hi>Trent</hi> Council ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly tells us,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Creſſie, p.</hi> 124.</note> that it is called ſo <hi>propriè, convenienter, &amp; aptiſſime,</hi> moſt fitly, <hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>conveniently.</hi> (3.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you tell us,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> that it is a difficult matter to define what is our Churches Tenent in this controverſie; I refer you to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107126:80"/>Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Diſcourſe upon this Subject: if you are able to except any thing againſt his Stating of the Queſtion do it; if not, ceaſe to calumniate, and know that the renewed Rubrick is an Explication of what the Church of <hi>England</hi> believeth in this matter; and if you have any thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce againſt it, beſides the empty name of <hi>Zuinglianiſme,</hi> we are ready to conſider it.</p>
               <p>But to paſs theſe things,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> let us come unto his evidence of ſuch a change of the Sacramental elements into the body, and blood of Chriſt, which makes Chriſt Corporally preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecies of Bread and Wine, but deſtroys their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and here not daring once to faſten upon <hi>hoc eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum,</hi> or the ſixth of <hi>John,</hi> he lays hold on a paſſage of Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. and tells us, that if this Tranſubſtantiation ſhould not be received,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Creſſie, p.</hi> 128.</note> 
                  <hi>none could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the body of Chriſt unworthily, becauſe according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants it is not the body of Chriſt, but meer bread, that an impenitent ſinner receives. And Saint</hi> Pauls <hi>charge would be irrationall when he ſays, ſuch an one receives judgement to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in that he doth not diſcern the Lords body.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> (1.) This Argument is a manifeſt contradiction to the Apoſtle, who ſaith, let a man examine himſelf,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup, for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily (<hi>viz.</hi> that bread and cup) eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body; ſo that the unworthy eater of the bread is the perſon that diſcerns not the Lords Body. (2.) Such perſons are ſaid not to diſcern the body of Chriſt, becauſe they deal with the Elements that are Inſtituted to repreſent his Body and Blood as with common meat, not treating them with addreſſes proper to the myſtery.

<q>If the change be not in the Elements, but in the receivers Soul; (that is, if the Elements be not tranſubſtantiated) what need is there of Conſecration? what effect can it have? why may not another man or woman as well as a Prieſt, adminiſter the

For if it remain water ſtill, may not I ask him what need of any Conſecration to become Sacramental? what effect can Conſecration have upon it? why may not another man or woman as well as a Prieſt, adminiſter <hi>this Sacrament?</hi> what hinders but we may have ſuch a preſence of Chriſt or the Holy Spirit every time we go to waſh our ſelves? This haply our Author ſaw, and therefore he durſt not ſay, if the elements be not tranſubſtantiated; but if the change be not in the Elements, which we grant it is, (the Bread is no longer common Bread, but holy, ſeparated from a prophane uſe to a ſacred; it is now become an inſtrument to convey the benefits of Chriſts death, which before it was not; repreſents Chriſt's broken body, which before it did not:) But Thirdly, to make a little ſport with his demonſtrations, Tell me, is there no uſe of Conſecration but to tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate? What is their Holy-water? Are all their Bells, their holy reliques and images, tranſubſtantiate? Secondly, Hath Chriſt required the Conſecration of the Euchariſt ſhould be done by a Prieſt, or not? If not, then let him tell me, why a Maſter of a family may not conſecrate theſe Elements as well as the Paſchal Lamb? If he hath required it, then ſurely, whether Tranſubſtantiation be true or falſe, it cannot be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a Laick. But, Thirdly, tell me, what is the Bread we eat at dinner, the Bread broken for us? Is the Wine the Papiſts drink on their <hi>faſting-dayes,</hi> the Blood ſhed for the remiſſion of their ſins? Do men by eating and drinking remember Chriſts death till he come? Have they any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſuch bleſſings from the partaking of their common Bread as Sacramental? If not, why doth our Author trouble us with ſuch a frivolous compariſon?</p>
               <p>He next proceeds to demonſtrate this change out of the Fathers,
<label type="milestone">

                  <q>Next, for the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 466. out of Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> that they are held a meer forgery. The true <hi>Nicene</hi> Acts (ſaith he) (except ſome fragments raked at ſecond hand out of ſeveral Authors) are ſufficiently known to be all loſt, as being made away, and having ſuffred ſhipwrack in the <hi>Arrian</hi> tempeſts; And again, whereas all ages have been moſt eager in the purſuit of ſo noble a Monument, never a man could hitherto find it; and concludes that now no hope remains of ſo fertile a vintage: Nay, when hard ſearch was made for a new <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon pretended by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in defence of his ſupremacy, and by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, and many Learned Biſhops more, meſſengers were diſpatch'd into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the firſt and beſt Copies were; News was return'd both from <hi>Atticus</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that no more of that Council could be found ſave onely twenty Canons.</q>
               </p>

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label>
                  <q>As for <hi>Nyſſen</hi> his <hi>Catech.

So the Author of the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, 1573. Thirdly, that it mentions <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> a full 100 years later then <hi>Cyrill.</hi> Fourthly, that it ſpeaks contrary to <hi>Nyſſen</hi> himſelf; and Fifthly, that it holds no correſpondence with all that <hi>Theodoret</hi> cites thence.</q> And laſtly, refers us to twelve Arguments of <hi>Spalatenſis,</hi> againſt this and the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> 
                  <hi>Cyrills</hi> Epiſtle <hi>ad Caloſyr.</hi> is not extant among his works; and whether <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> wrote it is very uncertain. And (albeit I can no where come to a peruſal of it, yet) it is capable of this ſence, <hi>Chriſt is not altered; (viz.</hi> the Sacrament repreſenting Chriſt is not alter'd) <hi>neither
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107126:82"/>is his Body</hi> (that is, the Symbols of his body changed) <hi>by being kept till another day but the virtue of Benediction and quickning grace perpetually remains in it;</hi> for what is it that is bleſſed? ſure not the Body of Chriſt, that being not preſent till after the benediction even when <hi>hoc eſt corpus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is pronounced; and therefore 'tis the Euchariſtical bread which he calls Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And yet were all theſe Authors true they might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by telling our adverſaries they might as well have cited our Common Prayer Book, which calls the Bread,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> the Body of our Lord Chriſt; and the Wine, his Blood ſhed for us. For we acknowledge it is ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> Sacramentally, and Repreſentatively, but not by any ſubſtantial Mutation.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the Fathers are quoted for adoration of the Euchariſt;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> and there are but two Sentences that can ſeem to incline to Tranſubſtantiation. The firſt is that of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> to wit, <hi>The moſt pretious thing in Heaven I will ſhew thee plac'd upon Earth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. <hi>Hom.</hi> 24.</note> But this may be fairly interpreted thus, That it is placed upon Earth in its repreſentation in thoſe Elements which convey the Virtue of his Body to us, and therefore deſervedly are called his Body. Let <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> interpret himſelf; who in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Caeſar. contra Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. Apollinar</hi> (cited by <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> and the Collector of the Sentences of the Fathers againſt the <hi>Severians,</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Turrian</hi>) hath theſe words. <hi>Before the Bread is ſanctified we name it Bread; but the Divine Grace ſanctifying it by the means of the Prieſt, it is freed from that Name, and is eſteemed worthy to be called the Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, although the nature of Bread remains in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet I muſt not forget to tell you,
<note place="margin">p. 130.</note> that whereas our Adverſary renders a Clauſe of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> ſentence, <hi>Thou not onely ſeeſt the body it ſelf;</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath it <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Learned Doctor had framed an Argument thus;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> That which remained the fruit of the Vine was not Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated: But the Wine in which Chriſt Celebrated the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament remained after Conſecration the fruit of the Vine. To this our Adverſary anſwers:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C.</hi> 132. S. 12.</note>
                  <q>I confidently pronounce it evident that theſe
<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 26.29.</note> words were neither ſpoken by our Lord in the ſame breath after the Conſecration of the Chalice, nor had they any regard to the Sacrament. And why ſo I pray you? Becauſe Saint <hi>Luke</hi> mentions them after the eating of the Paſchal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and antecedently to the Myſtical Conſecration of his bleſſed Body and Blood:</q> who ſaith he will write <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Anſ. A great reaſon of Confidence indeed! put it into Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givm, and it runs thus. That which hath reference to the Paſſeover, and the drinking of the Cup which was annexed to it, hath not Reference to the Sacrament of the Supper of our Lord: But theſe words have reference to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Now all their who tell us that Chriſt ſpake the ſentence twice will deny his Major, ſeeing the words might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to both according to their various times of utterance. Now that this Interpretation muſt take place againſt our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary I will prove; becauſe he grants it doth refer to the Paſs-over in Saint <hi>Luke:</hi> And evidently it refers to the Conſecrated Cup in Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>G.</hi> 26.</note> For he ſaith, Chriſt took the Cup, and gave it to them, ſaying, <hi>Drink you all of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107126:83"/>this:</hi> this, what? This in the Cup: why ſo? for this is my Blood, and then immediately follows: But I ſay unto you, I wil not drink henceforth of the fruit of the Vine, untill the day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom. Now then, this fruit of the Vine Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks of is this that the Diſciples are bid to drink of, as even the ſeries of the words ſhew; <hi>Drink ye all of this, for this is my Blood; but I will not drink of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The fruit of the Vine muſt neceſſarily demonſtrate ſome Wine; ſo St. <hi>Marks</hi> fruit of the Vine, muſt alſo have reference to ſome Cup demonſtrated by him: But they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no other Cup beſides this Sacramental: therefore they muſt neceſſarily ſpeak of this: and ſo much for his Major. Now I deny his Minor, which muſt be proved thus. That which S. <hi>Luke</hi> mentioned before any Conſecration began. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after, the Cup confeſſedly belonging to the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over muſt belong to it. But theſe words St. <hi>Luke</hi> thus men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now I retort upon his Major thus; That which Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Mark</hi> mentioned not till after Conſecration, and immediately after the Sacramental Cup, muſt belong to it; But this ſentence is thus mentioned by them. I know he will tell us the diſparity is in this, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> promiſed to write <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer; Grotius</hi> will tell him, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>ſignifies only <hi>ſigillatim,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.18.23. which Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt take place here, it appearing ſufficiently, that he frequently for the Coherence of things, joyns thoſe paſſages which were ſeparated in order of time
<note n="*" place="margin">As the ſame <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Comment doth evince, <hi>Vide Grot. in locum.</hi>
                  </note> and therefore this reaſon of diſparity is taken away.</p>
               <p>Thus I have confuted his Confidence;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Now though I dare not be Confident, I think it very probable,
<note place="margin">Vide Janſoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in locum.</note> that St <hi>Luke</hi> alſo ſpeaks of the Conſecrated Cup (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would have it) by preoccupation, that ſo this ſaying, paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to that of eating no more of the Paſsover, might be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. For <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeak of four things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this Sacramental Cup:
<list>
                     <item>1. Giving of Thanks.</item>
                     <item>2. Diſtribution of it.</item>

               <p n="4">(4.) His proteſtation of not drinking of it any more. Now Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks onely of the third of theſe, If you will not allow the other verſe to refer to the Sacred Cup. But if this be granted, then are all theſe actions mentioned in S. <hi>Luke</hi> directly as in the other Evangeliſts; Now then the interpretation makes all Harmonious between the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, whereas he bids defiance to S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who (as I have prov'd) muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be underſtood of the Euchariſtical Cup.</p>
               <p>But our Author hath another anſwer,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> if this fail, <hi>viz.</hi> that were it ſo that the wine after Conſecration were call'd the fruit of the Vine,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 133.</note>
                  <q>yet this doth not argue againſt a change of it's nature, for <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod after it was changed into a Serpent was call'd a Rod ſtill becauſe it had been one. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.12 And <hi>John</hi> 2.9. 'tis ſaid of the Maſter of the feaſt, shat he taſted the water that was made wine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this I return, (1.) That the caſes are no way parallel; for, firſt, in theſe inſtances, the matter remain'd, the form only being chang'd, it being proper converſion; but in the Euchariſt; the Trent Council hath defin'd, that the ſubſtance of Bread remains not, and ſo there is not ſo much Reaſon why it ſhould have the ſame name.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Theſe might well be call'd ſo, becauſe the Serpent was made out of a Rod, <hi>tanquam ex cauſâ materiali,</hi> and the wine out of water; but you dare not ſay, that the Blood of Chriſt is ſo made out of wine.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) There were Circumſtances annex'd in theſe Caſes, which did obviate all poſſibility of Fallacy. The Serpent is call'd a Rod, but ſuch a one as devour'd the other Rods; the wine mention'd by S. <hi>John</hi> is call'd Water; but 'tis Water made Wine; as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>panis tranſubſtantiatus,</hi> which phraſe you would not much diſlike; you will ſay, this Wine is call'd the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Well, but whether Spiritually, or Corporally, is not ſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We anſwer, that if this be a ſufficient reaſon why the Blood of Chriſt ſhould be call'd the fruit of the vine, though it be not really ſo; then may this be a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the bread may be call'd the body of Chriſt, though
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107126:84"/>it be not ſo;
<note place="margin">See <hi>Paraeus de Reg. phraſium Sacrament.</hi> In Cor. 11. v. 23.</note> becauſe Sacramental ſigns have often the names of the things ſignified by them. The ſequel is evident from the parity of Reaſon, the ſame foundation of Each being the Analogous phraſe of Scripture: and in the great hold of Tranſubſtantiation muſt be quitted.</p>
               <p>But (3.) He ſaith he will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine; which Argues, that before, <hi>viz.</hi> In other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs, Or at leaſt in this, He had drank of it before; now that which he had drank of before (this being the firſt inſtitution of the Sacramental Cup) muſt be really the fruit of the Vine; Well then, that which he ſaith he will drink of no more muſt be the ſame alſo.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid we may ſee ſufficiently the weakneſs of his argument hence for tranſubſtantiation,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> which runs thus. Our Saviour drank of the Conſecrated Cup, but he did not drink of the fruit of the vine, (becauſe he ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Conſecrated Cup was not the fruit of the Vine. For not to tell him,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Beza in locum. Heinſ.</hi> In Mat. c. 21, v. 41, &amp;c.</note> the <hi>Syriack</hi> Copies leave out the two verſes in which the ſtreſs of all this Argument lies, nor yet to mind him of <hi>Beza's</hi> tranſpoſition of the verſes, a * thing ſufficiently probable.)</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) How will he prove that our Saviour drank of the Conſecrated Cup? will he run to <hi>Matt.</hi> 26? Alas, He hath told us, that it Concerns not this Cup; will he cite uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal tradition? Let him ſhew it, and at the ſame time he will ſhew, that he interprets Saint <hi>Matth.</hi> contrary to them, ſeeing they that affirm it gather it from his words.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Why may not his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be thus interpreted; I will not drink any more, <hi>viz.</hi> after the ſolemnity ended? Have we not S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to bear us out in't; and Saint <hi>Mark</hi>'s, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which alſo may very well be borrowed from the 16 <hi>verſ.</hi> in Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> It being very ordinary for Sacred Writers to leave a particle to be underſtood from the words foregoing or conſequent. And if this interpretation ſtand, it can only be infer'd, that after the ſolemnity ended He drank no more of the fruit of the Vine, which advantageth him nothing.</p>
               <p>And yet (3.) If neither of theſe two anſwers could ſtand, yet ſeeing we have made it probable, if not neceſſary, that theſe words ſhould be underſtood of the Euchariſticall Cup,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107126:85"/>His argument falls to the ground irrevocably.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> For a cloſe, I will mind him of what <hi>Janſenius</hi> has long ago told him, that this Argument is frivolous and unconcluding. Hence it appears,
<note place="margin">In locum.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>How infirm that Argument is, which ſome of our men ſuppoſe efficacious to prove Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from this that Chriſt ſaid,</hi> non bibam de genimine vitis, <hi>inferring, that what he drank of was not ſo,</hi> &amp;c. For (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould we grant,</hi> (which yet is leſs probable,) <hi>that this was ſaid by S.</hi> Luke <hi>before the Conſecration, yet</hi> by <hi>Saint</hi> Matth. <hi>and</hi> Mark, <hi>it ſeems clearly to be ſpoken after;</hi> ſo <hi>that our arguing from uncertainties, which with greater proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities may be rejected then alledged, will never be ſufficient to eſtabliſh any Dogma, or opinion, but rather give occaſion to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick's to be more pertinacious in their Errours, when they ſee ſuch weak arguments brought againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have vindicated the Doctours Arguments;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> I will but adde one more,
<note place="margin">Mich. le Faucheur de la eene de Signeur.</note> though I can tell him where to meet with an hundred; and that is this: That which the Apoſtle ſix or ſeven times in one or two Chapters calls Bread is bread; but the Euchariſt after conſecration is ſo call'd by the Apoſtle. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26.27, 28. The minor is evident to any that hath eyes, and will believe them.</p>
               <p>The major I prove thus, (1) If that which is once call'd the body of Chriſt be ſufficiently argued to be ſo, albeit it hath all the accidents of another thing, and ſeems to all our ſenſes to be ſo, then that which is called Bread ſeven times, and ſeems to all our ſenſes ſo to be, is ſufficiently proved to be ſo, but the firſt is true. For the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> thence proves the Body of Chriſt to be Corporally in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it doth it efficaciouſly, then it muſt be ſo; If not, then 'tis not an infallible interpreter of Scripture nor is their argument thence concluding. Now, that this was ſaid but once by Chriſt, albeit repeated by three Evangeliſts and one apoſtle, is clear. This ſequel is alſo evident; For there is greater reaſon for the one then the other, <hi>viz.</hi> That what is ſeven times called bread by the Spirit of God ſhould be ſo, when all our ſenſes teſtifie it, then that which was but once call'd the body of Chriſt ſhould be ſo, in Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the ſenſes of the Univerſe.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:107126:85"/>
               <p>To cite all the Fathers that here ſpeak for us would be an endleſs work;

               <p>And firſt, the place which he cites out of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> will not conclude his purpoſe. For albeit he ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Ho.</hi> 24.</note> let us imitate the barbarous <hi>Magi,</hi> yet does he not ſay (as our Authors parentheſis would have him) that we ſhould imitate them in worſhipping our Lord, but onely tells us that they addreſs'd themſelves unto him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with a great deal of fear or horrour: Let us therefore ſtir up our ſelves, (ſaith he) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the compariſon requires. And that this word ordinarily bears the ſence, if any would farther be inform'd, let him have recourſe to <hi>Beza,</hi> or any other Commentator upon the 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 and he may receive ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Did <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> indeed ſpeak of Adoration, yet might he bid us imitate theſe <hi>Magi,</hi> not by adoring the Elements, but him that is repreſented by them.

                  <q>If the Primitive Church had ever taught that Divine worſhip was to be given to the Sacrament, it had been certain that the Heathen would have retorted moſt of the Arguments upon their heads, by which the Chriſtians reproved their worſhipping of Images. The Chriſtians upbraided them with worſhipping the works of their hands, to which themſelves gave what figure they pleaſed, and then by certain formes conſecrated them; and made by invocation (as they ſuppoſed) a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to dwell there. They objected to them, that they worſhipped that which could neither ſee, nor hear, nor ſmell, nor taſte, nor move, nor underſtand; That which could grow old and periſh, that could be broken and burn'd, that was ſubject to the injury of rats and mice, of worms and creeping things, that can be taken by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and carried away; That is kept under lock and key for fear of Thieves, and ſacrilegious perſons: Now if the Church of thoſe ages had practis'd and thought, as they have at <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe laſt ages, might not they have ſaid, why might not we as well as you? Do not you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that with divine honours, and call it your God, which can be burnt and broken, which your ſelves form into a round or ſquare figure, which the oven firſt hardens: And then your Prieſts conſecrate, and by invocation make to be your God, which can ſee no more, nor hear, nor ſmell, then the ſilver and gold upon our images. Do not you adore that which rats and mice eat? which can grow mouldy and ſowre, which you keep under locks and barrs for fear your God be ſtolne? Did not <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth pawn your Deity to the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> inſomuch that to this day the Egyptian Eſcucheons, by way of Triumph, bear upon them a pix with a wafer in it? True it is, that if we are beaten from our Cities we carry our gods with us; But did not the Jeſuites carry your Hoſt, (which you call God) about their necks from <hi>Venice</hi> in the time of their interdict? And now, why do you reprove that in us which you do your ſelves? What could have been anſwer'd to them if the Doctrine and accidents of the times had furniſhed them
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107126:87"/>with the like inſtances? In vain it would have been to have replyed; Yea, but ours is the true God, and yours the falſe gods. For they would eaſily have made a rejoynder, that this is to be prov'd by ſome other Argument: In the mean time, all your Objections againſt our worſhipping of Images return violently upon you, upon this account; ſince none of the witty and ſubtle Adverſaries of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ever did or could make this defence by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination, it is certain there was no occaſion given; And therefore thoſe trifling pretences made out of ſome ſayings of the Fathers, pretending the practice of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Sacrament, muſt needs be Sophiſtry and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and need no particular conſideration.</q>

But were not there wiſe and ſubtle Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, ſuch as <hi>Julian,</hi> ſuch as the peſecutors of the Church forc'd to relinquiſh their profeſſion of Chriſtianity? Such as turn'd Chriſtians chiefly upon theſe Arguments, enforced upon them by the Champions of the Chriſtian cauſe? Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, that even in his time all that were in <hi>Aſia fell away from the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. And could it be that none of theſe ſhould be able to retort this Objection? Was it not ſtrange that none of the Converts of the Church ſhould be ſcandaliz'd at this, when as <hi>Avicenna</hi> preſently cries out, <hi>Quandoquidem Chriſtiani adorant, quod comedunt, ſit anima mea cum Philoſophis.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others cited in his Margine do not ſay, that the Infants which communicated received in one kind <hi>onely,</hi> and that they mention but one kind, doth prove no more the thing in conteſt, then Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> charge of the unworthy perſons not diſcerning the Lords Body proves that he participated not of the Cup; or if he did participate, diſcern'd it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay that Infants did communicate in both kinds;

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107126:90"/>about the year 580. the now mentioned Decree of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> was repeated in the third Council of <hi>Bracca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and all ſet right again according to the perpetual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church, and the inſtitution of our bleſſed Lord: and their pretence (which was, leſt they ſhould ſpill any thing of the holy Chalice) laid aſide as trifling and ſuperſtitious.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His third inſtance is the Communicating of the ſick and penitents at the point of death,

                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which according to him was in one kind: Now to this we ſay, that the two laſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers given to the former inſtance ſuit to this. For the Church did ſometimes adminiſter the bread dipped in the Chalice to dying perſons; And upon that occaſion alſo it was abuſed, and the oppoſition now mentioned was made to that abuſe.

               <p n="3">3. We ſay, and that out of the ſame Authors by him ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſuch did communicate in both kinds. This appears by the charge that <hi>Dionyſius Alexand.</hi>

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Firſt, He ſhould have made this good by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and not have produced it back'd with no authority; eſpecially when,</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis manifeſt from their aſſerting the neceſſity of both ſpecies, that they would not omit it if it could be otherwiſe; and therefore <hi>Greg.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If this were practis'd,
<note place="margin">This Anſwer agrees to all the fore-mentioned inſtances.</note> it was onely in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and that which is onely made lawful by an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity, when that neceſſity is taken away is unlawful; And indeed, by the ſame reaſon a Jew might have prov'd the neglect of Circumciſion lawful at any time, becauſe when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> travell'd in the wilderneſs, by reaſon of their uncertain removes, it was neceſſary to omit it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I cannot tell what neceſſity of communicating in one kind ſhould happen to them, ſince they might take Wine with them, or go to Land to procure it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As to the Communions ſent to other Provinces,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> I know they were wont to ſend a loaf to one another, in token of mutual Friendſhip, Love, and Unity; Yea, they had their <hi>Eulogia,</hi> in token of their Communion in the ſame Church. <hi>Stillingfleet, Iren. p.</hi> 399, 370. But that they participated of it as Sacramental Bread, or that they did it without Wine; or doing it ſo, ſuppoſed themſelves to celebrate an entire Sacrament, are things remaining to be proved. And thus we have endeavoured to return ſomewhat ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory unto our Adverſaries pretences for Juſtification of their half-Communion; It remains, that I briefly confute the ſame, which I ſhall endeavour by theſe degrees.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Chriſt Inſtituted the Sacrament in both kinds;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> this is granted by our Authour, nor could he poſſibly deny it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I ſay Chriſt Inſtituted in both kinds not only for Prieſts but Laicks; which appears (1.) from the Reaſons annex'd to the receiving of both kinds; and (1.) The Reaſon of their receiving the bread is this; becauſe 'tis the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107126:91"/>body broken for them; take it (ſaith our Saviour) this is my body which was broken for you;
<note place="margin">Ratio legis eſt lex.</note> This therefore being the Reaſon why they were to take and eat, and this Reaſon concerning all believers as well as the Apoſtles and other prieſts, the inſtitution or precept to take and eat moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently concern them; and if it do not, by what Argument will they conclude, that this Inſtitution, as to any part of it, concerns Women, yea, or the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles? Now transfer the Argument to the cup, and it runs thus; The Reaſon of participating of the Cup,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.28.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> (Becauſe it is the Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins) doth concern Laicks as well as prieſts: Therefore the command [drink ye all of this] to which the Reaſon is annex'd,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> concerns them alſo. Again, another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we muſt do this, why we muſt eat the Bread, and drink the Cup, is, that we may remember Chriſts death, and ſhew it forth till His ſecond coming, as the Scripture ſpeaks, and all the world acknowledgeth; and doth not this concern all believers as well as prieſts? Yea, ſeeing the words recorded, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this blood,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.24, 25, 26.</note> you ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> were not (as we can find in any of the Evangeliſts) ſpoken by our Saviour, they muſt be ſpoken by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the words preceding, <hi>this do, as often as you drink, in remembrance of me,</hi> muſt belong to them by reaſon of the connective particle, which connects the 25 and 26 verſes; and makes it neceſſary, that the ſame perſons ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to in the words; this do, &amp;c. for as often as ye eat, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again,

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> as ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (who I ſuppoſe were not all prieſts) upon this account exhorting them not to partake of Idol Sacrifices (in which I ſuppoſe he did not grant a liberty to the people, but intended by this argument to reſtrain them from partaking of the table of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107126:91"/>Devils, as well as prieſts.) The Major is evident, for ſure it concerns Laicks to partake of that which is to them the Communion or Communication of the body of Chriſt: this argument may alſo be transferred unto the Cup: for that being the Communion of the blood of Chriſt, when wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily receiv'd, as well as the bread, it equally concerns them to participate of that as of the bread.</p>
               <p>Now that which I foreſee may be return'd to theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is this;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> That the people by participating of the bread do participate of the Cup, which is the blood ſhed for the remiſſion of their ſins; that is, they participate of that which is the blood, it being concomitant with the bread, and ſo the bread is the Communion of the body of Chriſt; but not ſo only, but alſo of his blood.</p>
               <p>Now (1) (To omit the refutation of this figment of concomitance till anon) this Anſwer deſtroys the Energy of Chriſts words, who, after they had participated of the body, bids them alſo drink of this cup, becauſe it was his blood ſhed for ſinners, when as yet he knew that they had already done ſo, and could have told him that he might have ſpared his cup and his Reaſon both.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Were this ſo, then would the participation of the cup be evidently ſuperfiuous, it being Inſtituted after the participation of the body, to exhibit that blood to us which by the participation of the Body was already exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>

But
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107126:92"/>if they receiv'd in the capacity of Chriſtians onely, then they receiv'd the Commandment for drinking in the Chalice for themſelves, and for all Chriſtians. Their uſual evaſion is, that the Apoſtles as Laicks receiv'd the Bread; But then when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>hoc facite,</hi> he made them Prieſts, and then gave them the Chalice as repreſentatives of the Clergy, not of the people.</p>
               <p>This one would think were a ſtrange ſhift, and yet 'tis ſuch a one as they are forced to fly unto.</p>
               <p>But, Firſt, Let it be conſidered how unlikely 'tis that Chriſt ſhould at one time inſtitute two Sacraments (for they pretend Ordination alſo to be a Sacrament) of ſo different natures, and yet ſpeak nothing of the uſe, or the reaſon, the benefit or the neceſſity of one of them; nor tell them that he did ſo, nor explicate the myſterie, nor diſtinguiſh the rite or the words, but leave all this to be ſuppoſed by the moſt improbable conſtruction in the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Apoſtles were made Prieſts by <hi>hoc facite,</hi> ſpoken before the inſtitution of the Chalice, then doth not <hi>hoc facite,</hi> ſignifie <hi>offerte ſacrificium,</hi> as the <hi>Trent</hi> Council (that infallible interpreter of Scripture) would have it, and conſequently cannot make them Prieſts, that is, in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Sacrificers. For by their own Doctrine to offer both kinds is neceſſary to a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Apoſtles were thus made Prieſts, and drank of the Chalice under that capacity, then ſeeing this is a Command (as we preſently ſhall evince) it ought to be followed, at leaſt ſo far, and all the Prieſts that are preſent ought to receive the Chalice; which becauſe they do not in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is apparent that they praevaricate the inſtitution; and that they may exclude the Laity from the Cup, they uſe their Clergy as bad when non-Conficients.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> I ſay, that the inſtitution of Chriſt touching the receiving of both Elements ought not to be violated.

               <p n="1">1. From theſe words, Chap. 34. <hi>The Oblation of the Church which the Lord taught us to be offered in the whole world is reputed a pure ſacrifice before God, and acceptable to him; not becauſe God wants our gift or ſacrifice; but becauſe he that offereth is glorified thereby if his gift be accepted: When therefore thou offereſt this gift at the Altar:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 5.24, 25.</note> Go firſt and be reconciled to thy brother, then come and offer it. <hi>You muſt therefore offer to God the firſt fruits of his creatures;
<note place="margin">Deut. 16.26.</note> as Moſes ſaid,</hi> Thou ſhalt not appear empty before God. Now had he ſpoken of the ſacrifice of Chriſts Body and Blood, would he have told us that it is reputed apure ſacrifice, not is ſo; when to be, and to be reputed are diſparates.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, the Oblation which he ſpeaks of is that which all Chriſtians offer not the Prieſt onely as is evident from the two places cited, <hi>when thou offereſt thy gift. And thou ſhalt not appear empty before God.</hi> Seeing therefore that the firſt fruits of the creature to be offered to God here, are not the Body and Blood of Chriſt; (and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us that he ſpeaks of this Oblation which the Church offers throughout all the world) neither can that be ſuch.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You have a further Evidence in that it is ſaid, We offer this ſacrifice to God; <hi>not that he wants it, but that we ſhould not be unfruitful,</hi> For that this paſſage muſt refer to Almes, not to Chriſts Body; Let <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himſelf aſſure us, who in this 34. Chapter tells us, that <hi>God wants not any thing of ours; but yet 'tis needful we offer ſomewhat to him:</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:107126:97"/>for, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pro. 19.17.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hath mercy on the poor lendeth to the Lord; and that God which wants nothing yet takes our good works as done to him, that he may give us a reward of his good things for them, as our Lord ſaith,</hi> Come you bleſſed of my Father <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for I was an hungry and you gave me to eat; I,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.25.</note> and a little after he tells us, that <hi>God will have theſe things done by us, that we may not be unfruitful;</hi> ſo that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently this refers to Almes and the Oblations at the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, not of the Euchariſt; and therefore the ſame words in this Sentence touching the ſame matter, muſt in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be eſteemed to refer unto them alſo.</p>
               <p>Again, in the ſame Chapter he addes, <hi>The Sacrifice doth not ſanctifie the man, but the conſcience of him that offers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pure, doth ſanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ifie the Sacrifice.</hi> Seeing therefore with ſimplicity (or ſincerity.) <hi>The Church doth offer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is juſtly reputed pure by God.</hi> And hence it is that Saint <hi>Paul calls them an Odour of ſweetneſs, an Offering acceptable and well pleaſing unto God: For we muſt offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God;</hi> Thus <hi>the Church offers to him the firſt Fruits, and that of his Creatures;</hi> and a little after, we <hi>offer, ſanctifying the Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt, can it be tollerably ſaid, we <hi>ſanctifie</hi> the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſts body, and that it ſanctifieth not us? That this ſacrifice is <hi>reputed</hi> pure before God from our ſincerity in offering? That the Apoſtle in the place now cited, ſpeaks of the Body of Chriſt, not Alms? And conſequently can the Offering of the firſt Fruits of his Creatures be any other? Seeing therefore this Offering of the New Teſtament which the Church offers is expreſly ſaid to be <hi>primitias ſuorum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum, the firſt fruits of her gifts offered to him that affords us ſuſtenance:</hi> is it not rationally inferred, that it refers alſo to theſe Almes and Oblations made at the Sacrament, not to any Oblation of the Sacrament? well then;</p>

               <p>Our ſecond Conſideration is, that the Euchariſt may be called a ſacrifice ſymbollically, as repreſenting, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome way impetrating for us all the benefits of Chriſts real ſacrifice on the Croſs: For ſeeing the ſignes are often put for the things ſignified,

                  </q> Now (not to note, that if this be the ordinary conception of a ſacrifice, that then the Fathers muſt be granted in this matter to have ſpoken contrary to the ordinary ſence which the word beareth, and to that which it is ſuppoſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to import, (1) hence it is clear that he holds the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Euchariſt to be only a commemoration of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; which we will endeavour to evince from his own words (only premizing that Chriſts ſacrifice was a reall immolation, and ſhedding of his blood) thus; where there is only a commemoration of the reall immolation, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſts blood, there is only the commemoration of Chriſts ſacrifice offered on the Croſs, but here (that is, in the celebration of the Maſs,) there is only a commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a former reall immolation, and ſhedding of Chriſts blood, and therefore a commemoration only of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;

Or Secondly, as this word is taken in a ſtricter ſence, to ſignifie a ſacrifice
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107126:100"/>of inanimate things, as fruits, incenſe, &amp;c. (and thus it is diſtinguiſhed from a ſacrifice of an animate being, which was accompanied with an <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Fourthly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> Therefore that this is no true and proper ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice appears, (1.) becauſe to a proper ſacrifice is requiſite that the thing ſacrificed ſuffer ſome Phyſical mutation; but here is no Phyſical mutation of the thing ſacrificed: the Major is proved by <hi>Bell:</hi> from the perpetuall uſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when ſpeaking of a proper ſacrifice; for what ever in Scripture is properly ſo call'd was neceſſarily to ſuffer ſuch a mutation, if it had life, by the deprivation of it; if it were an inanimate and ſolid, being as Frankincenſe, Salt, &amp;c. by combuſtion; if liquid, as wine, blood, and water, by effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He proves it, becauſe all the Sacraments did prefigure the death of Chriſt, their death or mutation being Typical of his; with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> conſents Cardinal <hi>Alanus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Eucha. ſacrif. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> who tells us, that unleſs the intervention of ſome mutation be allowed to the nature of a ſacrifice, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that firſt-fruits, Tythes, the firſt-born, religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and innumerable other things (which in the Law were conſecrated to God) muſt be called ſacrifices; there being no difference in them from true and proper ſacrifices imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable but this, that theſe gifts thus conſecrated remain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, but the things which are ſacrificed do not, but ſuffer as it were a change into another ſpecies; being either kill'd, roaſted, bruiſed, or boiled, or by ſome other action of the Prieſt conſumed; But now there is no real mutation here of the thing ſacrificed; for the thing ſacrificed <hi>is the very ſame body and blood which our Lord offered upon the Croſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:107126:101"/>as our Author tells us,
<note place="margin">P. 148. and p. 135. <hi>We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an oral manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or change in the divine body it ſelf.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and the victim</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuffers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> But ſhould he eat his words as he doth his God? I will thus force him to confeſſe the truth; If the body of Chriſt ſuffer any mutation when ſacrificed, then either as to its real being in Heaven, or its Sacramental, but neither can with reaſon be affirmed. Not the firſt, for Chriſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body is now impaſſible; not the ſecond, for then would the body of Chriſt loſe its being in the Sacrament; which, firſt, is contrary to what
<note n="*" place="margin">P. 131.</note> he himſelf produceth from <hi>Cyrils</hi> Epiſtle <hi>ad Caloſyrium;</hi> And, ſecondly, were it ſo, either it loſeth this Sacramental being when it is eaten, or before or after, <hi>viz.</hi> when the ſpecies of bread ceaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. If this laſt, then is it ſacrificed in the belly, not on the Altar; if when it is eaten, 'tis ſacrificed in the mouth; if before, then do not the Communicants eat the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if this be ſufficient to make it a proper mutation, becauſe the body of Chriſt loſeth his <hi>eſſe Sacramentale,</hi> and ceaſeth to be preſent under theſe ſpecies; then by parity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, God himſelf (and his Angels) may be ſaid to ſuffer a real Phyſical mutation, when he ceaſeth to be where he was, by the deſtruction of that wherein he was, or the annihilation of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If Chriſt did not offer a true and proper ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then neither do his Miniſters; but the firſt is ſo; the ſequel is evident; becauſe that which is delivered to us to be done, was receiv'd from Chriſt; for ſeeing it is deliver'd by the Evangeliſts and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and we are peremptorily told by him delivering what the Evangeliſts had rehearſed, that he received it of Chriſt, and delivered no other thing; If Chriſt did not offer a true and proper ſacrifice, neither did he deliver it to us from Chriſt; but Chriſt did not offer ſuch a ſacrifice;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiſt. Conc.</hi> Trent.</note> for then the oblation of the Croſs would have been ſuperfluous, becauſe Mankind would have been redeemed by that of the Supper, which went before. Beſides, the Sacrament of the Altar was inſtituted by Chriſt for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of that which he offered on the Croſs; now there cannot be a memorial but of a thing paſt, and therefore the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107126:101"/>Euchariſt could not be a ſacrifice before the oblation of Chriſt on the Croſs, but ſhewed what we were afterwards to do.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, The picture of <hi>Cromwell</hi> or <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> the parts of the <hi>Rebels</hi> that hang up at the Gates of <hi>London, Spaniſh Inquiſition, Iriſh Rebellions, Popiſh Cruelties to the</hi> Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>and</hi> Albingenſes, yea, the picture of Hell and the Devil, are apt to bring their cruelties and torments into our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances; and doing ſo, may not I adreſſe my ſelf with Praiſes and Thanksgivings to this God who hath delivered us from ſuch <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and pray heartily to be freed from the torments of Hell, and tyranny of <hi>Satan?</hi> Is not there as much reaſon for my devotion here, as at the ſight of an Image? yea, the very names of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> Heaven and Hell, are as ſubſervient to the productions of ſuch thoughts; and therefore when I read in a play, Heavens bleſs, &amp;c. muſt I turn to my devotions?

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> C. <hi>p.</hi> 156.</note> And,</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<q>You tell us, that in Scripture we find Kings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, and a proſtration of body paid to them; yet for all this, no man will ſuſpect that any diſhonour was intended to God thereby.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> True, and yet you may diſhonour him by giving this worſhip unto Images, ſeeing he hath commanded, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them, which your <hi>Gerſon</hi> paraphraſeth thus:
<note place="margin">In comp. Theol. explic. praecepti. primi.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down to them with the veneration of thy body,</hi> ut inclinando eis, vel genu flectendo: <hi>Nor ſhalt thou worſhip them with the affection of thy mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Cap. de Imag.</note> The Divines of <hi>Saumur</hi> have already told you, this is a wide ſequel from the honour done to the (living) Image of God, to infer we may bow and kneel to Images; whereas the one lives, the other wants all ſenſe and motion; the one is civil worſhip, and ſuch as hath the precept and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the other neither.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:107126:107"/>
               <p>Thirdly, What did <hi>Job</hi> mean by telling us,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27.</note> that had he kiſſed his hand upon the beholding of the Gun, (that glorious pourtraicture of Gods power, Wiſdome, and Goodneſſe,) he had been guilty of Idolatry; our Author could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him better, by telling him that Children kiſſe their hands when they do homage to their Superiors; yea, he had leſſe reaſon to ſuſpect himſelf then Papiſts have; for God hath ſet the Sun in the firmament to give light unto this truth, that there is a wiſe diſpoſer and orderer of all things, but never appointed any Images to be a <hi>medium</hi> to bring us to the knowledge or ſervice of him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">P. 157.</note>
                  <q>You argue that Images are capable of a ſinful diſreſpect, and conſequently a due reſpect may be paid unto them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We may grant all this, and yet not bow unto them, as queſtioning whether that reſpect be due unto them; I ſuppoſe you do not bow to the picture of his Majeſty, and yet you will not deny that due reſpect may be paid unto it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Surplice or Cope, &amp;c. yea a good advice, are capable of diſreſpect; and yet will you infer that this is motive ſufficient for us to come down upon our knees before them?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, An Image is not capable of any diſreſpect by the neglect of religious actions or veneration, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, is not capable of any ſuch reſpect by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <q>You tell us that by honouring with outward regard a picture, you intend onely to give a teſtimony what reſpect you bear to the perſon or holy thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by it; ſo the reverence that we ſhew to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> picture ſignifies onely we venerate Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt,
<q>This is a contradiction to what immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately precedes, <hi>viz.</hi> that we give a reſpect unto them, becauſe ſuch ſacred things as fix our thoughts upon objects, good for our Souls.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We ſay 'tis evidently abſurd; and that upon the ſame ſcore you may bow and kneel to, go bare before, and kiſſe a Lyon, Eagle, or an Ox, as repreſenting St. <hi>Mark,</hi> Saint <hi>John,</hi> Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:107126:108"/>
               <p>Thirdly, This pretence might have been made by the Jews, in venerating the Calf; yea, the very Heathens have inſtructed you in this leſſon, as I have ſhewed before: Now to requite your ſtory.</p>
               <p>I ſhall return you one Argument amongſt many lying by me,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> which haply ere long may beg your Anſwer; and it is this; To offer incenſe to an Image is to commit Idolatry; the Papiſts uſe to offer incenſe to their Images, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are wont to commit Idolatry:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>de Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, c.</hi> 13. <hi>In tertiam partem,</hi> Th. <hi>p.</hi> 25. <hi>ar.</hi> 3. <hi>diſt.</hi> 2 <hi>num.</hi> 15.</note> The <hi>minor</hi> is evident from their own Authors, who tell us, <hi>ſuaves odores etiam offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus in Eccleſia</hi> (not onely <hi>coram imagine,</hi> but, <hi>Imaginibus) &amp; reliquiis.</hi> Thus <hi>Bellarmiue,</hi> and <hi>Petrus de Cubrera,</hi> amongſt the things to be perform'd to Images, reckoneth <hi>Oblationes Suffituum;</hi> Yea, the Roman Pontifical, ſet forth by <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, informs us in the Chapter of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of the Croſs,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mox cam incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari,</hi> i. e. <hi>ei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſum adoleri.</hi>
                  </note> that the Pope puts incenſe into the Cenſer, then ſprinkles it with holy-water, and preſently offers Incenſe to it; The <hi>major</hi> I evince from the Idolatry of the Iſraelites, in offering Incenſe to the brazen Serpent, the reaſon being evidently the ſame; for whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, that the Iſraelites did offer Incenſe to it, <hi>tanquam Deo,</hi> if he means they gave it that worſhip which was due to God, 'tis very true, but a confirmation of what we ſay; that to offer Incenſe to a creature is to give it the honour due to God: if he mean that the Iſraelites eſteemed it as God, 'tis ſhamefully ridiculous to imagine that what had been ſo long kept without any ſign of the leaſt virtue proceeding from it, ſhould preſently. be thought by them to be the maker of Heaven and Earth, that which they knew to have been made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet to have been before all time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He tells us, that Incenſe was a ſacrifice under the Old Teſtament, becauſe none but Prieſts might offer it; not ſo now, becauſe in their Church 'tis offered by them that are not ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So then, it ſeems, if a whole <hi>Hecatomb</hi> ſhould be offered not onely to God, but to the people (as he tells us their Incenſe is) 'twould not be a ſacrifice, if not offered by a Prieſt, and conſequently not Idolatry; nor could any of the Chriſtians that were not Prieſts by offering to Idols com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:107126:108"/>
               <p>Secondly, How ridiculous is it from an inſtance in his own Churches behaviour, which we accuſe of manifeſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, to prove that they are not Idolaters. Well then, ſeeing there can be no ſufficient diſparity,
<note place="margin">John 3.</note> this being a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Chriſt as well as their Images, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not becauſe a God, but as an inſtrument which God had uſed to work miracles by; or the like; if we can evince that this was Idolatry, we ſhew alſo that the Papiſts are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters; now that this is ſo, may be gathered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the Context, which reekons it with the confeſs'd Inſtruments of Idolatry;
<note place="margin">2 Kings 18.4.</note> 
                  <hi>He removed the high places, and brake the Images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen Serpent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, Secondly, He calls it <hi>Nehuſtan,</hi> a piece of braſſe, of which appellation no other reaſon can be eaſily aſſigned, but that this was done in oppoſition to their Idolatry, in giving it that worſhip which could by no means agree to a piece of braſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſin that occaſioned the breaking of this Serpent, was the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> offering Incenſe to it; now 'tis evident this was no ſin againſt the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no breach of the Sabbath, no taking of Gods Name in vain; for if it were an acknowledgment of it for a Deity, it was the moſt groſs Idolatry; and therefore the Romaniſt will not yield to that: Well then, it muſt be a ſin againſt the ſecond Commandement; it cannot be a ſin againſt any other clauſe of it then this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not worſhip Images,</hi> or as the Papiſts will needs have it, <hi>Idols;</hi> and if ſo, it muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be Idolatry: Again, did they give <hi>dulia</hi> onely to it, or <hi>latria?</hi> if the firſt, then can you not ſay they ſinned, or did any thing which ſhould juſtly cauſe it to be broken: Seeing you acknowledge <hi>dulia</hi> due unto your Images; if <hi>latria,</hi> then again, according to your own principles, they were the groſſeſt of Idolaters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Idolatry of <hi>Achaz</hi> is thus deſcribed, that he made high places wherein to burn Incenſe unto other gods, and likewiſe the Idolatry of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> This burning Incenſe is therefore Idolatry,
<note place="margin">Jer. 44.21, 23.</note> becauſe the Nature of Idolatry agrees to it, which is to give the honour due unto God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107126:109"/>unto another thing; and therefore ſeeing this was done by burning Incenſe to the brazen Serpent, that alſo muſt be Idolatry; for to ſay that 'tis not ſufficient to make an act idolatrous, that it attributes the honour due to God unto another thing, unleſſe it be an Idol, is very falſe; for then the offering of ſacrifice to the Image of Chriſt would not be Idolatry; the giving it <hi>latria</hi> terminated thereon, would not be ſo: The <hi>Arrians</hi> could not have been accuſed of Idolatry in worſhipping our Saviour with divine hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and yet eſteeming him to be <gap reason="foreign">

<q>what was it (ſaith he) but Scripture as it was uſed, and of which uſe themſelves were the firſt cauſe <hi>(by ſuffering it freely to be Read)</hi> and hereafter will never be able to prevent that juſtified diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment againſt the Government Civil and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, that put ſwords and guns into the hands of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt their King, and all that were faithful to him, that diſſolv'd the entire frame of the Kingdome, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged men to plunder: and all manner of Rapine, that arraigned and murthered our laſt and excellent King, that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107126:111"/>endanger'd the life of his moſt Gracious Majeſty now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and forced him into a long neceſſitous Baniſhment; that has revived and given ſtrength to old and new mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Hereſies, to the aſtoniſhment of mankind, ſome of which are no where elſe to be ſeen, and the reſt in no place ſo venemous as in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And why doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thus ſpit her venome againſt the Word of God?
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> Is it not becauſe ſhe knows her deeds of darkneſs cannot endure the lights approachment? She knows how impoſſible it is to keep up her Idolatry in worſhipping Images, if ſhe permit the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment entire to the people. How impoſſible it is to cheat them with an half Communion, if they permit them to ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: How impoſſible 'tis to keep their latine ſervice, in defiance of the word of God, and yet permit that word to come into their hands thus abuſed by them. Could they ſet up their doctrine of Daemon's, or be approved in prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting of Marriage, if the people might be permitted to view their condemnation ſo legible, that he that runs may read it? But though the Roman Proctors cry out ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently of the dangerous Conſequences of this our practice, yet dare we not violate the Law of God, or ſuffer his Book to be a ſealed one unto our people: We dare not, with the Romaniſts bereave them of the Food of Life, and give them nothing but their poyſon in lieu thereof: We dare not deprive them of the Characters of a Bleſſed perſon,

<note place="margin">Joh. 5. v. 39.</note> requiring them to <hi>ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> we dare not bereave them of that Touch-ſtone of Truth, the Law and the Teſtimonies to which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to have recourſe; we dare not imitate their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge who rob them of that Law which is the rule they are to walk by,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 197.</note> that Law that converts the ſoul, that ſo they may continue Aliens from God;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> thoſe Teſtimonies that make wiſe the ſimple, that ſo they may continue in their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and be induced to worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, as the Vulgar Papiſts do; that Law which enlightneth their Eyes,

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> If theſe Enormities and Rebellions were to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the uſe of Scripture, ſince it is manifeſt, that in the Primitive times they read it vulgarly, and were exhorted ſo to do: What is the Reaſon, no perſecutions, no preſſures, no torments could prevail upon them to rebel? Why is it they enter'd into ſolemn Covenants not to defraud each other by theft and rapine, nor to ingage in any of the like implicities? Was it not the awe of Scripture they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pretended? Was it not becauſe they had no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſedition in their Pulpits, to allarm them to war; but had wholſome Texts of Scripture preſſed upon them, and may not we hope that the like practice of our Miniſters may produce ſuch Loyaltie?</p>
               <p>Again, may not we as well argue, that the reſtraining of Scripture is thus pernicious? What made the Iriſh Rebels deſtroy ſo many thouſands in cold blood? Was it not the reſtraining of that Scripture from them, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill?</hi> What made ſo many illiterate Papiſts be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the Gun-powder Treaſon? Was it not the reſtraint of that Scripture, which cries out touch not mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed which made the inſurrection thereupon? Was it not the reſtraint of the Scripture, telling us, that to reſiſt is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107126:112"/>the ready way to procure Damnation to our ſelves?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> To whom do we owe all theſe monſters of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie he ſo complains of? Are they not all hatch'd by the Jeſuit? Have not ſome of them been Butchers, ſome Smiths, ſome Captains in the Army,
<note place="margin">See the Jeſuits Letter in <hi>Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, coll. ct.</hi>
                  </note> and done all that they could to invent and broach new Doctrines? Was it not a Jeſuit who tells us, <hi>How ſome of their own Coat have re-incountred themſelves, how admirably in ſpeech and geſture they could act the Puritan?</hi> Theſe, theſe are they who have induſtriouſly led others to Hell, induſtriouſly inſtructed them in damnable Doctrines, ſtudying how they might by damning ſo many Souls make way for their Idolatry and Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing it is evident, that it was not the common people that wreſted theſe Scriptures of their own accord, but Jeſuits (and others) that taught them ſo to do; what follows? Not ſurely that Scripture ſhould be hid from them; but that all Jeſuits, Popiſh Prieſts, men that can teach them what they know will infallibly lead them into Hell, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p>And as for the rebellions of the people, if the Scripture had any hand in them, it was onely thus, as it was wreſted by the Preachers: Theſe were the Trumpets of ſedition, who cried out ſo loudly, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz;</hi> And had not theſe men wreſted the Scripture, the people would have been at quiet. Now ſurely this Argument proves nothing againſt the permiſſion of the publick uſe of Scripture, but onely the wreſted interpretations of it made by ſeditious Miniſters; and infers this onely, that ſeditious Preachers ought moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be prevented, and moſt ſeverely puniſhed, as Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries of the State.</p>
               <p>Again, that you may ſee how inſtrumental the Holy Scriptures were in the promoting theſe Rebellions, were not the forwardeſt in them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Quaker, Anabaptiſt,</hi> &amp;c. to quit themſelves of theſe enforcements of Obedience from Scripture, forced either to throw off Scripture, and run to the light within them, or to preſent Impulſes of the Spirit, or, thirdly, to ſay they might comply with providence againſt precept? Was there any thing more cogent to keep many thouſands from ſuch rebellion, then that place
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107126:112"/>of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans? &amp;c.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.</note> And how were the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of the people forced to winde and turn and ſqueeze it, that they might perſwade the multitude of the legality of their actions? And yet at laſt could not by any means effect it, but by telling them that the Parliament was equal to the King, and ſo robbing him of his higher Power: Yea,</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> Had the Scripture been kept from the common people, and they had none of theſe Texts to go to, how far more eaſily might their ſeditious Preachers have led them into rebellion? What could they have had to return to their urgent ſollicitations? And do not theſe men well to pretend friendſhip to his Majeſty, who would have Scripture hid from his Subjects eyes, that ſo they might have nothing to reſtrain them from the like enormities?</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> To argue from this accidental abuſe of Scripture to the with-holding it, is as ridiculous as may be: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, How hard a thing is it to make a right uſe of the grace of God? Do not the generality of men abuſe it, and turn it into wantonneſſe? And yet, I hope, this doth not hinder but the people may be made acquainted with it as revealed in the Goſpel: Yea,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Did not our Saviour know how likely the Jews were to reject and crucifie him, to blaſpheme his miracles, and continue obſtinate againſt all the evidences of his being the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> And will our Author add, that therefore he ſhould not have been revealed unto them?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, who knows not how hard a thing it is for perſons to have parts and not be proud of them, to be in high places, and not be partiall, tyrannical, or addicted to ſome vices, which commonly attend ſuch greatneſſe? Shall we therefore have no Magiſtrates? Shall we have no endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to procure the greateſt talents?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Yea, on the ſame ground, ſeeing the Common-Prayer and the Ceremonies were accidentally the cauſe of the War; and we ſee by experience, how unlike, weak, and unſtable men are to make good uſe of them, they muſt down too.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Seeing the power of Parliaments was ſo abuſed,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107126:113"/>it would be neceſſary to diſſolve them: ſeeing preaching and inſtructing of the people was abuſed moſt of all, It would be requiſite (a thing which the Papiſts heartily deſire) to hinder that: Yea, ſeeing that, among the old Hereſies, ſcarce one was broach'd but by the Learned, and our late ſwarms of monſtrous opinions were evidently the products of Learned Men, whether Jeſuits or others; If this Argument were good, it would rather prove that Scripture ſhould be with-held from the Learned, then from the vulgar ſort of people.</p>

So earneſt was God with them to be acquainted with his Word, albeit it ſeemed not then ſo full of moral precepts, ſo plain and intelligible, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the New Teſtament: Yea, and the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> commends it, as that which will make wiſe, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſimple, as that which is more to be deſired then glod, not rejected as poyſon.

                  <hi>That Catholicks knowing how impoſſible it is for ignorant perſons to underſtand it, and for paſſionate minds to make good uſe of it; think it more conducing to Edification, that ſuch eaſily miſled Souls ſhould be taught their duties rather by plain Catechiſmes and inſt ructions, prudently, and with all clearneſs gathered out of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Be it ſo, but let them not perſwade us to think that the one muſt exclude the other, when we proteſt againſt them ſtill for doing ſo; let them not be angry, if we with our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles think both expedient, and very much conducing to Edification, if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here in this to the Primitive Church, and among other inſtructions exhort them diligently to read the Scripture: Nor do we think any perſon ſo ignorant that can read, as not
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107126:114"/>to know the Eſſentials of his Chriſtianity, and to find things plain and eaſie which will ſuffice for his Salvation; Nor is it therefore fit to be reſtrain'd, becauſe we have ſome of <hi>paſſionate minds,</hi> which, whileſt ſuch, are not like to make good uſe of the Word of God, no more then they are to be hindred from a good Sermon, Catechiſme, or other means of inſtruction; becauſe, whilſt ſuch, they are not like to make good uſe of them; or to be deprived of their goods, becauſe they are apt to abuſe the creature. But rather they are to read the Scripture, that they may learn thereby to lay aſide their paſſion.</p>
               <p>'Tis true,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> what he tells us, <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>That the abuſe of Scripture by ignorant and paſſionate Laicks is not ſo certain and probable to follow in the Catholick Church, where men are bred up in a belief of that moſt neceſſary duty of ſubmiſſion, even of their minds to her authority, for the delivery of the onely true ſence of Scripture; whereas in our Church no perſon can be perſwaded that the ſence of Scripture given by us, can challenge an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal aſſent, or that it may not with ſin be contradicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then we ſay, Firſt, If this be ſo, how can you plead the danger of your peoples erring, as a pretence to reſtrain Scripture, when as this would more confirm them, they being bred up in a belief, that what ſence you put upon Scripture is the mind of God? What an evident contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therefore is there in theſe two pretences?</p>
               <p>Secondly, We dare not thus Lord it over the Conſciences of men, as not thinking we have any ſuch aſſiſtance of the Scripture, as will guide us infallibly into the true ſence of Scripture; and therefore ſuppoſing our ſelves fallible, we do not bind our people to an internal aſſent unto our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations upon our ſole authority, leſt we ſhould bind them to believe an Errour; Glad would we be to find the Roman Church indued with this infallibility; how faſt would we neſtle into her boſome were it ſo? But we know that chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge is vain and idle: Yet ſeeing they pretend thus much, is it not a wonder that this Church, which hath authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her to deliver the true ſence of the Scripture, ſhould never do it? To what end, I pray you, hath God given it, but that your people ſhould have the benefit thereof? Why
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107126:114"/>then are parties at ſo great a variance among you, about the true ſence of Scripture, and your Church ſtill neglects the exerciſe of its authority, in putting an end to thoſe ſtrifes, by her declaration of it? But ſpeak your Conſcience; do you not know or fear that this would be a moſt convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt that infallibility you ſo much boaſt of? When we ſhould make it appear (as no doubt we could) that ſome of your interpretations were falſe, and contrray to the infallible Rule of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Therefore albeit we do not require of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they ſhould aſſent to ſuch an interpretation of Scripture, becauſe that we who interpret it are guided by an infallible Spirit; yet do we ſay that the people ought to receive the interpretation of doubtful places from the Paſtors God hath placed over them, not contradicting them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out evident reaſon, but ſubmiting to them; that when they are by ſome paſſage of Scripture induced to think otherwiſe, they ought not preſently to condemn the Church of Errours, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon their own weakneſs, and ſeek for better information from men of Learning and Judgement, and acquieſce in it; unleſſe they can evidently ſhew that they err in their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. And indeed, I could never perſwade my ſelf that the vulgar Jews were bound to accept all thoſe falſe and corrupt interpretations which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> put upon Scripture; And indeed, had they been ſo obliged, then might they have refuſed to give maintenance either to Father or Mother, by telling them that it was <hi>Corban</hi> by which they ſhould be relieved; yea, then they were bound to believe that our Saviour Chriſt was not the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that he was not from God, but an <hi>Impoſtor:</hi> Well then, either theſe were Judges infallible or not; if ſo, then the abſurdity fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd is not avoidable; if not, then let him tell us what other infallible Judge they had, or acknowledge they had none; and if ſo, then I ask leave to inquire what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have we to think the people ſhould have ſuch a one under the Goſpel, when they were far more ignorant under the Law, nor had ſuch guidance of the Spirit to lead them into all truth; and yet God did not then think it meet to conſtitute ſuch a one.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:107126:115"/>
               <p>Well,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> but our Adverſary ſeems to triumph in an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Scripture againſt the reading of this Sacred book,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C.</hi> 168.</note> and it may thus be formed; Certainly none of them whom we know to be apt to pervert the Scriptures ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to read them.
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> But the unlearned and unſtable are apt to do ſo: therefore, &amp;c. And for Confirmation of this we are told, that the unlearned and unſtable of <hi>England</hi> are 99 of each hundred; therefore if they are not to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to read the Scripture, 99 of each hundred in <hi>England</hi> ſhould not be permitted. To this Argument we reply,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That the major is falſe, as is evident. For tell me, were not the Jews apt to pervert the Scripture? who were yet commanded to be daily converſant in the ſame? were not the Scribes and Phariſees apt to pervert Scripture? And yet our Saviour bids the one ſearch the Scripture: tells the other, that they erre not knowing the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Doth not Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt. chap.</hi> 1. preſcribe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the word as a remedy to keep us from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of falſe prophets? And if you will ſay, with <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> we are bid indeed to attend to Scripture, but as preach'd by the Paſtours of the Church, not read, the contrary is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident; for 'tis a word of prophecy, which holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt; and ſure, that is the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) If this were true, then were the fathers much to blame, who call'd the Heretiques to Scripture, bid them look to Scripture and ſee their Errours, when it is notorious that they were made Hereticks by perverting Scripture. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to the minor I ſay, that the Apoſtle doth not ſay, that ſuch are apt to pervert all Scripture, but ſomething hard and difficult in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle and other Scripture; and now, the benefit we receive by the other places not ſo hard may recompence the danger.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I ſay the unlearned are ſo, if they proceed to judge of the ſcripture, and will take things in their own ſence without going to God for direction, begging his Spirit, and uſing the help of the guides ſet over them; whence 'tis well infer'd, they ſhould not read ſcripture, without a ſenſe of weakneſs and aptneſs to pervert it, when they permit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107126:115"/>to draw concluſions and decide controverſies by it: and therefore ſhould not read it after ſuch a manner; but pray to God more for his Aſſiſtance in reading, and have cloſer dependance on the guides that are given them, and not dote upon queſtions, which adminiſter ſtrife, rather then edifying.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of this Chapter is taken up in a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able defence of their Churches prayers in an unknown tongue, which cannot more effectually be confuted,
<label type="milestone">

               <p>And (1.) he tells the Doctor,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> C. p. 172.</note> that he <hi>miſtakes the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches meaning, as if one of it's poſitions were, that Gods publick worſhip ought to be in an unknown tongue; or as if it forbad the people to underſtand it, And truly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if it were ſo, we could never hope to be reconciled with that paſſage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, out of Saint</hi> Paul, 1 Cor. 14.13. thus he: <hi>Anſw.</hi> But where I pray you hath the Doctor one <hi>Iota</hi> from whence you can be able to make good this charge? why did you not direct us to his words from whence this conſequence could be infer'd? but confidently tell him he miſtakes, when as 'tis only your prevarication makes him do ſo? did you peruſe that paragraph, or not? if you did not, then what <hi>unparallel'd boldneſs</hi> was it at all adventures to charge him with miſtakes? if you did, what <hi>wilfull inſincerity</hi> was it to charge him with that which you knew to be a palpable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Had he affirmed what you unjuſtly charge him with, yet might he very eaſily be freed from a miſtake; for ſeeing your <hi>Trent</hi> Conventicle hath determined that 'tis not expedient that the publick ſervice ſhould be celebrated in the vulgar Tongue, it muſt have conſequently determined that it ought not to be ſo; ſeeing the Apoſtles rule requires that in things lawful in themſelves we ſhould be guided,

                  </note> as to practiſe, by expedience, and conſequently that if the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue be not expedient in Gods publick ſervice, it <hi>ought not</hi> to be uſed; and if ſo then ſure a tongue not vulgar or unknown, muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> take place.</p>

               <p>Again, he argues thus,

               </p>

               <p>Fourthly, We deny that the Latine tongue is the moſt publick in Europe, or that there is any fitneſs that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God ſhould be celebrated in all Europe in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which is moſt publick.</p>

               <p>Your laſt evaſion is,

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is not this a ſhrew'd ſign of a ſinking cauſe to lay hold upon ſuch bul-ruſhes as theſe? to catch at ſuch vain and empty ſhadows? what, is it better that the poor people ſhould want the bread of life, the comfort and edification of the Churches ſervice, then buy a Common Prayer Book once in 20 or perhaps an 100 years? Is there any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being undone by ſuch a contribution of the pariſh that in an age will rob each family of a ſingle peny? ſhould theſe infallible keepers of the truth of God fear the loſs of their Religion upon the change of a word or (2.)

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> thus exhorts theſe emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of the gift of tongues, that ſeeing they ſo importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired to abound in gifts, they would do it to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, endeavouring to excel in that which tends unto this noble end. Now what was that? the Apoſtle Anſ. The interpreting of tongues, that the people may know <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the import of the voice, wherefore (ſeeing we ought with greateſt vigor to purſue
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107126:119"/>(thoſe things that make moſt for the edification of the Church) he that ſpeaketh with an unknown tongue let him pray that he may interpret, where two things may be inquired.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To what part of ſervice that verſe refers.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Prayer, As is evident from the reaſon given, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. Let him pray that he may interpret, for if <hi>I pray in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why muſt he pray that he may interpret?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That the Church <hi>may receive edification, verſ.</hi> 5. Yea, this is farther evident from the ſeries of the words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. ſeek that you may excell to the edification of the Church; wherefore let him that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret, as alſo from the Apoſtles precept; that all things ſhould be done to edification, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer. Now hence I argue.</p>
               <p>That which is requiſite, that we may excell to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, we ought to practiſe in our publick prayers; for as much as the Apoſtle bids us ſeek to excell (in this matter) to the edification of the Church; but praying in a tongue known to the people which joyn in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with us is requiſite to this and (this being the end of our praying that we may interpret) therefore we ought to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it. Our Authour here tells us that the <hi>Trent</hi> Council ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the mind of the Apoſtle, in that ſhe hath commanded all Paſtors, during the Celebration of the Maſs, to expound ſome part of what is read. An Anſwer worthy ſuch a cauſe.</p>
               <p>For (1.) Was it ever heard before that expounding perhaps an Epiſtle or Goſpel (or ſomething elſe, which to be ſure is not a prayer) ſhould be interpreting the Churches Prayer? or dare he affirm that the Paſtors interpret their Prayers as they are Read?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Doth the Apoſtle require that onely ſome part of the Prayer ſhould be interpreted? is there not equall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the whole? eſpecially when he adds, let <hi>all</hi> be done for edification?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Were this done frequently, yet it is evident that the Apoſtles precept would be neglected, though more rarely:</p>
               <p>His 2 <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall confute in conſideration of the 16. <hi>v.</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:107126:119"/>It follows.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>23</label> For if I pray in an unknown tongue my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit prays, that is,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note> the extraordinary gift of the Spirit in me; thus <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Photius:</hi> I know the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> by Spirit underſtand affections, and make the ſence run thus; in this caſe my heart and affections pray, albeit I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not what I ſay; But were this the truth, that he that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue underſtandeth not himſelf;</p>
               <p>Then (1.) We muſt acknowledge that when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles at the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> were endued with the gift of tongues, they underſtood not what they ſaid; which will not eaſily be granted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in this Chapter, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imports the gift of tongues, and therefore moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it doth ſo here.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Fathers generally do thus interpret it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the three already cited; Saint <hi>Hierom, Baſil, Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius</hi> are clearly for this ſence, and therefore <hi>Papiſts</hi> cannot without perjury run counter to it.</p>
               <p>But (4.) The Apoſtle in this very Chapter tells us, he that ſpeaks with tongues edifies himſelf, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and alſo that where the voice is not underſtood it doth not edifie. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, In the very next <hi>verſe</hi> he requires that over and above praying by the ſpirit, we ſhould adde praying with the Underſtanding alſo; ſo that how ever you interpret your praying with the ſpirit, yet muſt you pray ſo alſo as to be underſtood: well then our Expoſition muſt take place. It follows, but my mind is unfruitful, that is the reaſon why an unknown tongue is prohibited in prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe although our ſpiritual gift perform it's work, the mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unfruitfull: now here by mind ſome underſtand the Intellect, ſome (as the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi>) the matter of the prayer, which is the effect of the mind, and made out of the conceptions that we have of the neceſſities of Gods Church, &amp;c. But this is not material in our diſpute; this mind is ſaid to be unfruitful, not to our ſelves, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going arguments evince, but to the hearer; thus Saint Jerome, <hi>mens ejus non ipſi efficitur fine fructu ſed audienti,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In loeum.</note>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:107126:120"/>and Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi>

                  <hi>with my mind</hi> (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) <hi>that I may inſtruct others, then ten thouſand in an unknown tongue;</hi> now hence I argue, That which makes the prayer unfruitful to the hearers ought not to be done, (this being the reaſon of the Apoſtles prohibition) but the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of publick prayers in an unknown tongue makes them unfruitful to the hearer.</p>

                  </gap>, for to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the mind of him that prays is to make a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous inference, after this manner, if you uſe only the gift of the Spirit you will be unfruitfull unto others, therefore pray ſo as to underſtand your ſelf, or that your mind may be employed; Nay, it is further evident from the next verſe, which tells us that otherwiſe the <hi>Ideot</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay <hi>Amen;</hi> Now ſurely my underſtanding my own mind, will nothing contribute unto the <hi>Ideot,</hi> or make him more able to ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> Well then, to pray with the mind, or underſtanding, is to pray ſo as that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, made up of learned and unlearned, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the import of our words, and ſo this verſe affords us a third Argument.

                  </gap>, he is an <hi>Ideot:</hi> And thus the Fathers generally interpret it; <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius, indoctum,</hi> and <hi>Plebium, Jerome,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret, laicum; Ambroſe, imperitum, Sedulius, Anſelme, Haymo,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aquinas, propriam linguam tantum modò ſcientem,</hi> all in <hi>locum.</hi> Well then, this Ideot is he that underſtands not the learned Tongues; and the Congregation is divided into two parts, (ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13.) the literate, and the unlearned; and prayers in an unknown Tongue are here prohibited, becauſe the unlearned part of the Church are not able to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> unto them; and the reaſon given, becauſe they underſtand not what is ſaid by him that prayeth in ſuch a Tongue: Whence we infer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That 'tis the duty of the unlearned to joyn with the Miniſter in prayer, for he muſt ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do if he joyn not with him; that is, if his underſtanding doth not accompany his prayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ſuch are unable to perform this duty, unleſſe they underſtand the matter of the prayer; for that is the reaſon aſſigned by the Apoſtle, why they cannot ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> is not barely to pronounce
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107126:121"/>the word (for that aſſuredly might be done by him that underſtands not what we ſay) but to profeſſe our Aſſent to what is prayed, our willingneſſe that it ſhould be granted, our confirmation of the benediction; which the Ideot cannot do, as not knowing whether thou doſt beg a bleſſing, or imprecate a curſe; whether thou bleſſeſt God, or rather doſt blaſpheme him: Now hence I argue,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That which the Ideot or unlearned cannot ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to is not to be uſed in the <hi>Church;</hi> but prayer in an unknown. Tongue is ſuch, according to the Apoſtles Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which the Ideot underſtands not is not to be uſed in the Church (becauſe he cannot ſay <hi>Amen</hi> thereto but an unknown Tongue) is that which the Ideot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not; and conſequently ought not to be uſed in the Church.</p>
               <p>Now here our Author anſwereth; That the Latine Tongue is alwayes a known Tongue to ſome, if not to all; and there are alwayes of thoſe that underſtandingly ſay <hi>Amen:</hi> But,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What is this to the purpoſe, when the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth the Congregation into the Ideot and others, and blames the prayers which were uttered in an unknown Tongue, becauſe they were ſuch as the Ideot could not underſtand; will he have the whole Church, beſides the Miniſter, to be Ideots?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Is God an accepter of perſons? would he have the learned edified by the Churches ſervice, which have leaſt need of theſe helps, and the unlearned want the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit? If not, muſt it not be acknowledged that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Reaſon dictated by the Spirit of God concernes them both?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Is it not the duty of the unlearned to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> unto the prayers that are uſed in publick ſervice? And if ſo, then muſt he alſo underſtand them; for otherwiſe as the Apoſtle here aſſures us, he cannot do it.</p>

And there being ſevereal Books both in Engliſh, and all vulgar Languages, that expound the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice, even to the meaneſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer. Quid verba audio cum facta videam,</hi> what do you tell us, that ſuch and ſuch things might by the due attention of the ignorant be done; When it is notoriouſly known, that the people ſtill continue ignorant? and whileſt it is ſo, you tranſgreſſe the Laws of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> by praying in a Tongue they underſtand not? was it not notorious here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Q.

Let us have ſervice in a vulgar Tongue, untill you find the Latine ſervice underſtood, and then we will ceaſe to charge you with contradicting the <hi>Apoſtle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Could they at laſt be able to underſtand the <hi>Latine</hi> ſervice as to its chief parts, yet would not this
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:107126:122"/>acquit you from a violation of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> precept; Who would have every benediction ſpoken to their capacity, all things done to their edification; and conſequently, ſo a that they may be able to underſtand them? Do not his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conclude againſt the performance of any part of divine ſervice in an unknown Tongue? Seeing that Hymne, Prayer, or Pſalme, that is ſo performed, is ſuch by which the <hi>Ideot</hi> is not edified, with which he cannot joyn, as being not able to underſtand it: Yea farther, do you not read your leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and other portions of holy Scripture in <hi>Latine</hi> alſo?

               <p>Thirdly, is it not a thing extremely difficult, if not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible, for an <hi>illiterate</hi> perſon to retain in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory a bulky quarto Maſs; or at leaſt by comparing <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, &amp;c.</hi> with it to underſtand it, and be able to joyn with the <hi>Prieſt</hi> each Holy-day?

               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, For I might be endleſs, is the whole <hi>Maſs</hi> extant in theſe <hi>Manuals</hi> or not?

Are you diligent to inſtruct them what parts of their Engliſh <hi>Manuals,</hi> &amp;c. do Anſwer to the parts of their <hi>Maſs</hi> read on every day throughout the year? Do you ſuffer them to bring theſe Books into the Aſſemblies, and is it uſual ſo to do? Do you exhort them to the attention ſo requiſite to their underſtanding of the Churches ſervice, reprove them for not doing it? If you deal ſincerely with us here, all theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions muſt be anſwered in the affirmative, which I ſuppoſe you will bluſh to do.</p>

                  <hi>Lady in thy name let me be ſafe, and free me from my unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; have mercy upon me, and cleanſe me from all mine iniquities:</hi> and again,

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they pray for theſe things upon the account of the merits of the Saints. Thus the Roman Breviary <hi>By

<q>we may beg pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from one another, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did from the <hi>Epheſians</hi> (and others) c. 6.19. c. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. where he bids the Brethren pray for him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Very good, but yet we dare not beg from theſe our Brethren Grace, Glory, pardon of ſins; nor ſay with the Roman Breviary, to the Virgin <hi>Mary, We flye unto thee, O Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>for thy defence, and for as much as (being conſcious of our great offences, we fear the wrath of a ſevere Judge, whom we dare not ſee; We flye unto thee his Mother, that thou wouldſt intercede for us unto God, excuſe our ſins, and obtaining for its the Grace of thy Omnipotent Son procure us the pardon of what ever we have committed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <q>He tells us ſuch begging of prayers is far from Idolatry or diminution to Chriſt ſince holy perſons (li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or dead) are not invocated as donors, but fellow beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars with God for us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Why then doth your Breviary talk ſo often of procuring Grace and Glory, and the pardon of ſins, by the merits of the Saints? Why do you tell us, that by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs

               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, ſay you the refuſing of the aſſiſtance of thoſe whoſe prayers God more willingly hears is a neglect of uſing all means helpful to us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> True, but if the neglect of this Invocation of Saints, be the neglect of any means thus helpful, then were the Apoſtles negligent in giving us no intimation of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this particular: Yea, the Saints of God for ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of yeares under the Old Teſtament, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church for 300 years, muſt be accuſed of this negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; for of their practiſe in this caſe <hi>nullibi vola nec veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> Scripture and Hiſtories afford us no one Tittle, but pregnant Evidence to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But you proceed,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C.</hi> S. 5.</note> If the praiers to Sts. departed be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the merits &amp; interceſſions of our Lord,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> ſo is the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prayers of thoſe alive, if one be unlawful, ſo is the other: and if both be lawful, the prayers of Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted will be incomparably more effectual, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will better deſerve to be made uſe of then the other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Is it not then a wonder that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (if he may be permitted to have known as much as Mr. <hi>C.</hi>) ſhould thrice call upon his Brethren alive for their ſupplications, and yet not put up one Petition to a Saint or Angel?</p>
               <p>Secondly, We know it is the duty of living Saints to pray for one another but whether the Saints departed pray at all, whether for any in particular, and how far, we know not. We know a certain way to excite the Saints on earth to the performance of that Duty in reference to us; but we are ignorant of any way of conveighing our deſires to the Saints in Heaven. We have Rule, Preſident, and Command in Scripture for the firſt, not one jot of all theſe in reference to the ſecond: the Requeſts we make to the living are no elicite Acts of Religion, the requeſts made by the Romaniſt to the Saints departed are. We pray to the living neither directly nor indirectly, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107126:125"/>them only, by vertue of our Communion with them to aſſiſt us in their prayers, as we might ask an Alms or any other good turn at their hands the Saints departed are by you directly invocated, and in your devotions you imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſtep from God and Chriſt unto a Saint. We do not plead the merits of our Brethren, nor bid them do ſo in our behalf, you do both in reference to the Saints departed; we do not kneel to our Brethren, or ly proſtrate before them on theſe accounts; we do not invoke them in our Churches, inſert them into our Liturgies, believe them to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> any way, or that we are committed to their care or cuſtody; all this you do believe in inreference to the Saints departed: Is not this therefore a very good Argument if the prayers made to Saints departed by the Romaniſts, wherein they beg of them Grace and Glory, and all ſpiritual good things, truſt in their Patronage, plead for audience on the account of their merits be prejudicial to the merits of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and interceſſion of our Saviour, or otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; then muſt the asking of my brothers prayers (in ſpight of all theſe differences) be ſo.</p>
               <p>Again, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> informs us,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> that the moſt learned and ſober of our party, queſtion not whether the Saints pray for us in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But let me tell him that it is generally queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our <hi>French</hi> Divines. <hi>Chamier</hi> ſolves all their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the greateſt perſpicuity, except that ſingle one which is taken from the advancement of their Charity; whence you infer that they ſhould be more reſpectful of our welfare then they were on Earth, where they did afford us the benefit of their Prayers: but this Argument albeit the moſt plauſible, is yet unconſequent: for whileſt they were here on Earth, they haply procured good men to exhort their Relations unto Piety: if Miniſters ſpent themſelves in preaching, and the like, but in Heaven they ſend no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (that I ever heard of) on ſuch errands, nor have we any Preachers from the dead. Whileſt they were here, they were ſollicitous touching the welfare of their abſent friends; but do they now (think you) ask their Guardian Angel how 'tis with them?</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:107126:126"/>
               <p>Secondly, Notwithſtanding they have their Charity aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, yet will it not follow that they muſt pray for their friends below (much leſs for others) ſeeing haply the very knowledge of their friends may be hid from them: and were it otherwiſe, it may ſeem to be grievous to them to conſider in what ſtate many of their Relations have been left; add to this, that they have no certainty that they do not dy the next moment after them. Yea laſtly, how can any man aſſure me, that the Saints in Heaven pray at all?</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">P. 182. S. 6.</note> 
                  <q>You tell us theſe Learned ſober men will not deny that they may and do pray perſonally for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer known acquaintance, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> believed his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did for him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This I have already obviated and albeit ſome who are not willing to think contrary to what ſome Fathers do allow of may grant it to you; yet ſeeing you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce neither Scripture for it, nor the univerſal conſent of Fathers;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>To.</hi> 2. <hi>S.</hi> 8.</note> And ſeeing your Arguments are ſo clearly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Chamier,</hi> we take the liberty to deny, or at leaſt to queſtion it.</p>
               <p>Once more,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <q>Yov tell us they will grant, that albeit they be in Heaven, they may either by Gods Relation, or the Revelation of Angels be informed of the Prayers made to them by any others on Earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That this is not impoſſible at leaſt for God to do, we willingly acknowledge; but I very much doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Proteſtants allow that they actually do ſo, or that it is probable they ſhould be thus acquainted with our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or if any doe, they are never the more Learned for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis not perhaps impoſſible, there may be men in the Moon, and they good Chriſtians; and that if a Papiſt ſhould pray unto them, God or his Angels might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it: And yet I ſuppoſe, ſhould they upon this account become Petitioners unto them, they would be thought lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better then Lunaticks; yea the ſame may be ſaid of the Saints in Purgatory, which you affirm of the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and why then do you not pray unto them? Will you refuſe the aſſiſtance of thoſe who are perfected in Charity,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:107126:126"/>and other Graces, and conſequently whoſe Prayers God hears more willingly then your own? will not their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be more effectual? for ſure in Purgatory they will be ſervent, or will they refuſe to do us the kindneſs who do the like for them? ſure one good turn deſerves another; and if they will be ſo ſurly to us we, with the leave of his Holineſs, will be ſo to them.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, <q>Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 183.</note> will tell us that albeit this reſts upon ſo many <hi>uncertainties,</hi> yet is not that ſufficient to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from acknowledging that the practice of <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Saints</hi> by name, is very beneficial to them, and that on theſe accounts.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">P. <hi>Id. ibid.</hi>
                  </note> Becauſe the Angels are continually preſent with us on the Earth, and that it is by them we are defended
<q>from the Devils malice, who having ſuch a wonderful ſtrength ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ours, would otherwiſe deſtroy us all in our ſins, nor can it be ſaid that God hinders him, ſeeing he doth not ordinarily interpoſe his power immediately in Natural Actions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This then is the beſt figment they can Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and yet it is moſt ſtrangely ridiculous to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering man; for was it not the protection of God, which kept Satan from <hi>Job,</hi> ſo that he could do nothing without his Commiſſion: and when he had given him Commiſſion could not go beyond it? and may he not as eaſily do the ſame to others?</p>
               <p>Again, ſecondly the Scripture tells us, the Angels are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, ſent forth for the good of thoſe onely that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and why doth not the Devil poſt the wicked down into Hell preſently, ſeeing they have no ſuch good Angel to relieve them?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Will Mr. <hi>Croſſie</hi> ſay, that all the Cattle, the ſheep and Camels and Oxen; yea the Aſſes of <hi>Job</hi> had their Guardian Angels? if ſo we will allow our Authour one; if not, then let him tell us, why Satan complain'd he could not come at them.</p>
               <p>Again, Have the Tombes of the Martyrs, the holy reliques and Images of their Saints every one an Angel to keep them? if not, why doth not Satan break them, or conveigh them
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:107126:127"/>away? Unleſs perhaps he approves of your Idolatry; and how are ye ſure that your Reliques are not changed by him? Once more, and I have done; Have all the Houſes in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> all the Papiſts Houſes in <hi>Rome,</hi> as many Angels as will guard them, &amp; keep the Devil from ſetting fire on them? If ſo, the bleſſed Angels are well employed; if not, why doth not that Gand Enemy of Mankinde, ſet fire on them every Night?</p>
               <p>Again, when on the Lords Day all the Angels of ſo many Millions of ſouls come to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to tell him ſuch a one in treats his Prayers for ſuch a thing, who guards the perſons committed to their charge the while? or if theſe Angels be bound to ſtay here, who carries up the prayers to Saint Peter?</p>
               <p>Again, ſeeing ſo many prayers are put up to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Surely ſhe muſt do nothing elſe but <hi>pray,</hi> there being not one moment, when ſome or other do not pray to her, and then what time will ſhe have to hear theſe <hi>nimble Tàbellarii,</hi> telling her of <hi>New ſuitors,</hi> muſt they interrupt her in her Prayers?</p>
               <p>Again, Theſe Saints muſt not only be told when ſuch a one prayes; but whether Hypocritically or no, and ſo I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that queſtion muſt be asked of the Nuncio's. Now here is work enough for Saint <hi>Mary</hi> to receive ſo many Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers every day, and to enquire whether her ſuppliants pray in ſincerity or not. But haply it may be ſaid, if any one pray Hypocritically the Guardian Angel will not preſent that Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Very good, but ſeeing the Angel Guardian knows not the heart, How will he be able to judge of this? Once more, when all the Saints in Heaven are prayed to at once, (as it is in many Collects, and peculiarly on <hi>all Saints Dayes</hi>) ſurely that day is not an holy day to the Guardian Angel, who muſt be fain to trot to all the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and acquaint them that <hi>Serenus Creſſie</hi> being very ſick and weak deſires their prayers. But when they pray to all Angels, then the poor Angel muſt not travel over all the Heavens onely, but the Earth to boot.</p>
               <p>But we will not deal too ſeverely with him; let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:107126:127"/>and thus he doth it,
<q>Hiſtory tells us, that Magiclans have alwaies the Devil ready to come at their call; why then ſhould not Angels be witneſſes of our Actions,
<note place="margin">P. 184.</note> and eſpecially our prayers, which (as the Scrripture ſaith) they offer as Incenſe to God.</q> Now to I eave the Scripture till anon) Here we have more work for the Angel, for ſeeing 'tis an Angel, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8.3. that <hi>offers up the prayers and incenſe of all Saints,</hi> the Guardian Angel muſt make a journey to him to, unleſs you will have him to be Chriſt, which will do our Author but little ſervice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hiſtory likewiſe will tell us, that Magicians and Witches can ſwim over the Sea in a ſhell, can creep through a key-hole, Can dip their finger in a little juice and flie away out of the Chimnie, &amp; he may believe one as ſoonas the other. Laſtly, the number of Magitians (<hi>I</hi> hope) is few in compariſon of other men, and ſo there is ſome difference as to that, for one Devil may better afford to be nigh them, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſervice is ſo much promoted thereby. As to that diſpute of Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> which concludes the Section, I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he was very uncertain in it, and one while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and again ſuſpects that ſuch a thing might be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith only <hi>poſſit fieri,</hi> it may be done this way. And again,</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He further tells us,
<q>We are ignorant how great the ſphere of Activitie of the glorified Saints may be, in reſpect of this whole viſible world: perhaps ſaith he (in the words of <hi>Spalatenſis</hi>) the whole ſenſible world may be no more to one of them, then its proper body to an humane ſoul informing it.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And are not theſe men think you put to their ſhifts who are fain to coin ſuch inventions to ſalve their <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi> But tell me, is it probable they inform the whole world ſo, as to be preſent each of them in every part of the world?</p>
               <p>Or, Secondly, to operate in each part of the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not preſent there; If the firſt, then will they be little ſhort of omnipreſent, nor will it be proper to God to fill Heaven and Earth: and they being in Hell as well as Heaven,

                  </gap> only? How are the ſouls of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers delivered from their limbus, ſaid to depart thence, and to be with Chriſt? to be abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord; was <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s ſoul carried to Heaven, and afterwards extended?</p>
               <p>Again, to what end is this extenſion, ſeeing they may be happie without it, and why ſhould we imagine it, ſeeing here 'tis certain they are not extended beyond their bodies? If the ſecond, let them tell me how, or by what Operation, a ſoul that is in Heaven can tell that ſuch a one, who praies in his mind only, is praying to him? And ſuppoſe two were praying together, and the one prayed to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other to <hi>Paul;</hi> by what operation can theſe ſpirits diſcern that the one prayed to him, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I ſuppoſe a Praier to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes a different motion in their Orb of <hi>Aether;</hi> but then how doth St <hi>Paul</hi> know who it is that praies to him? Perhaps different men, make different motions; but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> never knew them, and how ſhall he be informed? Why, the Guardian Angel muſt go up, and tell him 'tis <hi>S. C.</hi> that makes ſuch a motion, and haply he will remember it. But how will he know when he prayes Hypocritically, why truly; when an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite praies it makes a different motion from a ſincere one in the ſpirits Orb of Air. This Platonical ſtuff is all that I can imgine to ſalve the Hypotheſes: <hi>Si quid noviſti rectius iſtis candidus imperti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, be it that their preſence or operations were ſo vaſt, yet could they not judge of the heart, ſeeing to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is proper to God, and conſequently muſt be as zealous for an Hypocrite as a devout Chriſtian.</p>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Bellar.</hi> himſelf confutes this Evaſion by 2 Arguments:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it were ſo, the Church would not ſay ſo boldly to all Saints, <hi>Orate pro nobis,</hi> but ſometimes would prayto God to reveal our deſires to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No good reaſon can be given, why Saints under the Old Teſtament ſhould not be invoked; for God might have revealed their Petitions to them, though <hi>in Limbo Patrum:</hi> and ſure their praiers might have been as beneficial as the praiers of ſuch as were alive.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Why upon the ſame preſumption ſhould we not pray to the Saints living? for albeit their praiers be not <hi>quite ſo</hi> effectual, as the praiers of Saints departed, yet they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and conſequently to neglect this will be to neglect one means conducing to our welfare. I ſay upon the ſame preſumption for this reaſon why God muſt be ſuppoſed to reveal our Praiers, can be no other then our good, and would not the reaſon move him to reveal them to. Saints on Earth, as well as thoſe in Heaven:
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> p. 185.</note> Oh but (ſaith our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie)
<q>If God ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Pilgrim on Earth, ſhall I hide from <hi>Abraham</hi> the thing that I do; how much more may we imagine, tha he hideth not the mightie works of his,</q> mercie and juſtice here from his Domeſtick Servants? 'Tis pitie that this Argument was not framed before the Church of Iſrael madeher complaint, that <hi>Abraham was ignorant of her?</hi> It would have taught her better divinity</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis no Demonſtration; ſure God would not hide from <hi>Abraham</hi> the thing he was to do, which concern'd ſo much his Brother <hi>Lot:</hi> (albeit he never revealed afterwards
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:107126:129"/>to any of his deareſt ſervants that we read of, unleſs his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, any ſuch thing: therefore he will reveal to any Saint in Heaven the praiers that are made to them by any perſon whatſoever. By what hath been ſaid I may be bold to infer, that the invocation of Saints is very fooliſh; and if ſo, that the Church of Rome is not infallible.</p>
               <p>But our Authour claps in two places of Scripture without any coherence at all,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> to prove I know not what; and albeit they have been anſwered an 150. times, (he ſhall not bate me a ſingle unite) Yet doth he bolt them forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any notice of the anſwers given:
<q>We read (ſaith he) not only an Angel, but every one of the four and twentie <hi>Elders to have in their hands golden Cenſers, and Vials full of Odours,
<note place="margin">Rev. 8.3.5.8.</note> which are the prayers of the Saints;</hi>
                  </q> that is, of their Brethren upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Now to take theſe two places in their Order:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Revel. 8.3 We read <hi>another Angel came and ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar, having a golden Cenſer and many Odours were given to him that he ſhould offer them with the prayers of all Saints, upon the Golden Altar, which was before the Throne:</hi> and verſe 4. <hi>The ſmoke of the Odours which came of the prayers of the Saints, aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 1. Let it be granted, that to one Angel was this given, to offer Odours to come up with the praiers of all Saints: How doth it follow that they are to be invocated? or that he knows when any particular perſon praies to him, or any other Saint? May not he offer up his incenſe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as knowing onely this, that praiers are made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If one Angel do this, How will it follow that all do it, or that all Saints?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If this be a created Angel, is there not a fine round of Praiers?</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are carried by an Angel, or revealed by God to the Saints, then he pteſeuts them to the Angel, the Angel to Chriſt, and Chriſt to the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Angel is ſaid to offer Odours, to come up with the praiers of all Saints, which ſurely is to do ſomwhat which may make them more acceptable to God, and will they
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:107126:129"/>ſay that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is no Saint? or that any Created Angel offers ſomwhat to God which makes her praier more acceptable? Well, but we denie it to have been a created Angel, but ſay it was the Angel of the Covenant, who by the incenſe of his merits and interceſſions, offers the praiers of all Saints to God, and makes them more acceptable unto him. For 'tis manifeſt, that here is reference to that which was uſed to be done in the Levitical adminiſtration; where the Prieſt entering the Temple offered Incenſe on the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Altar, whileſt the people in the Court put up their praiers to God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.10. Whence we may underſtand that phraſe that the Angel offered his Odours with the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Now the Levitical Prieſt, who offered incenſe, was a type of Chriſt, not of the Angels: and this is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle intimates, that Chriſt the Angel of the Covenant, Typified by the Levitical Prieſt, offers up the praiers, and ſighes of his members, groaning under the Tyrannie of wicked men, and by the incenſe of his merits makes them acceptable unto God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture is <hi>Apocal.</hi> 5.8. where we are told, <hi>That twenty foure Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them Harps and Golden Vials full of Odours in their hands, which are the prayers of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Many interpret theſe of the Elders of the Church as <hi>Beda</hi> in verſe 10. <hi>Here it is more plainly declared, that the Beaſts and the Elders are the Church, redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, and gathered from the Nations; alſo he ſheweth in what Heaven they are,</hi> ſaying, <hi>they ſhall reign upon the Earth.</hi> And ſo <hi>Irenaeus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> on the <hi>Apccalyps,</hi> and <hi>Haimo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Voſſius</hi> will tell you that here is nothing intended but Euchariſtical praiers, not petitory; and the four and twenty Elders onely intimate that the whole Family of Chriſtians in Earth and Heaven, did render continuall Doxologies to God for the redemption of the World by his Son.</p>
               <p>There is one Argument of greater moment inſiſted on, and that is taken from the <hi>miraculous effects, not onely of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:107126:130"/>prayers directed to God at the monuments of the Saints, but alſo directed to the Saints themſelves:</hi> Now to this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By denyal that any approved teſtimonies can be produced of ſuch miraculous effects wrought by any prayers immediately directed unto Saints; the Inſtances which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> refers us to, ſhall be anſwered anon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay that theſe pretended miracles may juſtly be ſuſpected for Satanical deluſions, and that upon ſeveral accounts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the ſilence of all undoubted Antiquity of any ſuch Sepulchre wonders, in the three firſt ages; albeit the Chriſtians long before had uſed to keep their aſſemblies at the Coemiteries and Monuments of their Martyrs. When God had ceaſed to exert his power as in former times; that he ſhould thus freſhly exert it upon theſe occaſions, ſeems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible; and that which cannot eaſily be admitted, by conſidering men who are acquainted with the Artifices of the Devil.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the nature of them, which rendreth them very ridiculous.
<note place="margin">Baſilius Selu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> Thus of Saint <hi>Thecla,</hi> we are told, that they who watch the night before her feſtivity do at at that time yearly ſee her, driving a fiery Chariot in the aire; and removing from <hi>Seleucia</hi> unto <hi>Daliſandus,</hi> a place which ſhe did principally affect in regard of the commodity and pleaſantneſs of the ſcituation; that when ſhe had demanded of <hi>Alypius</hi> the Grammarian,

                  </gap>, thou knoweſt, why ſhould I tell it thee that knoweſt all things? the Martyr being delighted partly with the man, and partly with the verſe, (for you muſt know that after her death ſhe was much affected with Poetry and Oratory,
<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 27.</note> that the Auditory was like to be quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed:
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:107126:130"/>But that the Martyr the ſame night appeared to him, and ſhaking him by the ear took all the pain away. He addeth further,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 16.</note> that when he begun to be weary of writing this ſame Book ſhe ſits her down cloſe by him, ſmiles whileſt ſhe reads it, ſhews her ſelf wonderfully pleaſed with it, and that it behoved him to finiſh it: The like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles we have related by <hi>Severus,</hi> of one <hi>Martinus</hi> a Monk,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De vita B. Mart. S.</hi> 24. <hi>Ibid. S.</hi> 17.</note> who could ſee the Devil though he remained in his own ſubſtance, fright him with the ſign of the Croſs continually; who putting his hand into the mouth of a Demoniack, forced the Devil out at his poſteriors; Yea, (which is moſt wonderful of all) that could by the ſmell of the body,

               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the old Daemons worſhip prevailed upon the world by the ſame means. Thus <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

                  <q>Search therefore the Deity of Chriſt, whether it be true or not; if it be that by the knowledge whereof a man ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to good, it follows then that the falſe be renounced, eſpecially that whole myſterie (of Daemon-worſhip) being diſcovered; which under the names and images of the dead through <hi>Signes, Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Oracles,</hi> obtaineth a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</q> And <hi>Chryſoſtome, they</hi> (the Gentile Daemons) <hi>often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their skill cured diſeaſes,

                     <hi>De Praep.

               <p>Thirdly, we Anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Stillingfleet <hi>p.</hi> 351.</note>
                  <q>That after the true Doctrine is confirmed by divine miracles, God may give the Devil power to work, if not real miracles, yet ſuch as men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge by the things themſelves whether they be ſo or no; and this for tryal whether we will forſake the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine confirmed by greater miracles, for the ſake of ſuch doctrines as are contrary there to; and are confirmed by falſe Prophets, by ſignes, and wonders: Now in this caſe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:107126:131"/>our rule of tryal muſt not ſo much be the miracles conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themſelves, whether real or no, as the comparing them with the miracles wrought in confirmation of that doctrine which is contrary to this, which theſe words tend to the proving of. Therefore Gods people under the Law were to examine the drift and ſcope of the miracles; and if they were intended to bring them to Idolatry, what ever they were they are forbid to hearken to them; as you may ſee moſt evidently, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. So now under the Goſpel, the worſhip of the true God through Jeſus Chriſt, and by the doctrine revealed by him, is the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard whereby we ought to judge of all pretenders unto miracles; ſo that let the miracles be what they will, if they contradict that doctrine which Chriſt revealed to the world, we are to look upon them as onely tryals of our faith in Chriſt, to ſee whether we love him with our whole hearts or no, and accordingly we look upon theſe miracles as tryals whether we will forſake the Head Chriſt Jeſus, give this worſhip of the Creator to the creature, and the like; and are ſufficiently warded againſt the force of this aſſault,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9.</note> by being told that Antichriſt muſt be uſhered in with ſignes and lying wonders.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, We add, that theſe miracles might have been done by God himſelf, and that at theſe Martyrs Tombs, but onely to confirm the faith they ſuffer'd for.</p>
               <p>Now as for the teſtimony of Antiquity in this point,
<label type="milestone">

               <p>Firſt, Many of the places produced by him ſpeak nothing of the Invocation of the Saints departed; nor do they infer any thing but what we generally confeſs; thus that of Saint <hi>Hillary</hi> tells us,

               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:107126:133"/>
               <p>Next for his 32. and 33. Homilies, <hi>de diverſis,</hi> I could have told him that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf doubts of 43. of them; <hi>Rivet</hi> of them all, but eſpecially of thoſe which were added by the Divines of <hi>Lovain,</hi> (and indeed we have reaſon to ſuſpect what ware you obtrude upon us) and therefore I take leave to paſs the ſentence thence cited over.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that which is cited from his Book, <hi>De cura pro mortuis,</hi> I interpret thus;
<note place="margin">Ut dum reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt ubi ſint pofita corum quos diligunt corpora, ciſdem Sanctis illos tantum patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos ſuſceptos apud Deum adjuvandos orando, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendent.</note> 
                  <hi>That whileſt they call to mind where the bodies of thoſe that are dear to them are laid, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the Saints as to Patrons, that by their prayers</hi> (or praying for them) <hi>they may be helped with the Lord;</hi> and then the Argument is null.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They may very well be ſaid to be commended to the Saints by praying to God for them, either at the Monuments of the Saints and Martyrs, or at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Saints and Martyrs; for that Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaketh of ſuch prayers as were to be directed to God, is evident from the very next Chapter; where continuing his diſcourſe, he tells us, <hi>that it very much concernes any, where they place the body of their deceaſed, who pray for his Spirit unto God; becauſe both the preceeding affection hath choſen an holy place, and the body being placed there the remembrance of that holy place renews and augments the affection:</hi> So then, they do commend them by praying, but it is to God, not to Saints and Angels; See Doctor <hi>Fernes</hi> Anſwer to <hi>Spencer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 276.</note> Nor is it any thing to the purpoſe that followeth, <hi>viz.

               <p>Secondly, This prayer, albeit poured out to God, may be ſtiled a commendation of him to the Martyr, becauſe done at the Monument or remembrance of the Martyr, even as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> in this very place tells us,
<note place="margin">Meritis Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyris.</note> that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the Soul is helped by the merits of the Martyr, <hi>Supplicatio quaedam eſt,</hi> is a kind of prayer; and if any thing profiteth, it is this:</p>

               <p>Secondly, As for that of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> it is proved ſpurious, not only becauſe we have no mention of it in <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> to whom you may add <hi>Photius,</hi> but alſo becauſe what is here cited from him directly contradicts what he hath in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Comment on the <hi>Coleſſians;</hi> this Argument you manfully skip over; and for your Anſwer to the firſt, that he mentions not ſome which are extant in <hi>Gennadius,</hi> if you had looked into the Preface of your <hi>Gennadius,</hi> you might have found that there were ſome things added to him; that he approves variety of Authours rejected by the Church; that he is under the cenſure of your Catholicks at <hi>Lovain,</hi> (enough to crack his credit with you,) And laſtly, that he names but two of his Books, one of which we have (though imperfect) the other is no where to be found: And yet if all theſe Fathers had given in their ſuffrages for you, they would not have advantaged you one whit; Seeing many of our Divines acknowledge, that about the fourth age (in which all your Fathers are comprehended) this corruption began to be introduced. Albeit, to tell you of it in <hi>tranſitu, Voſſius,</hi> who is cited by you for this confeſſion, doth, in his tenth Theſis, manifeſtly reſtrain his words to ſome; telling us that, <hi>plurimi invaleſcenti ſe errori opponcbant, p.</hi> 201. That very many oppoſed this errour.</p>
               <p>The Doctor had cited a paſſage from Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> which affirmes, that the <hi>Saints were not invoked by the Prieſt who ſacrificeth.</hi> Now to this, you tell us,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That here is an evidence for a ſacrifice, yea, and this <hi>Propitiatory;</hi> But how can you free your ſelf from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous dealing, when even in the place cited by you in anſwer to this Argument, Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> tells you, that he means onely <hi>Sacramentum Memoriae,</hi> which Proteſtants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as well as you.</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:107126:134"/>
               <p n="2">2. Have you not need to rub your forehead when you ſo conſidently tell us that the Doctor ſaith there was no ſuch thing as a Chriſtian Sacrifice; whereas that which hath given occaſion to your whole Diſcourſe upon this ſubject is onely this, that he tells us there were new Articles of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> The Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Doctrine of Purgatory impoſed on us; but doth he any where deny a Chriſtian Sacrifice, ſuch as before hath been granted by us, by the <hi>Trent</hi> Conventicle?</p>
               <p>Secondly, You tell us that the Saints are not ſovereignly invocated by way of ſacrifice, which is a meer imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; for S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth not ſay they are not ſacrificed unto, but are not ſo much as invocated by the Prieſt who ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth; farther you tell us that <hi>they are not invocated at the Maſs, nay nor the ſecond or third Perſon of the Trinity accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Canon of the Council of</hi> Carthage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Still you are reſolved to be impertinent; for what is this to you who in your Maſs invoke the whole Trinity, have 3 Collects to the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, as you are told by the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Andrews;</hi> yea what ſay you to that return of his to this Anſwer, <hi>what reaſon can be alledged why if the Saints may be pray'd unto they may not be ſo as well by the Prieſt as by the people,</hi> as <hi>well at Maſs, as at Mattins,</hi> as <hi>well at the Altar as in the body of the Church.</hi> Indeed you tell us it might have been lawful <hi>if the Church had ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it.</hi> But do you think S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> would have ſaid ſo too? is it not his buſineſs to diſtinguiſh betwixt the honour which was given to the Martyrs by the Chriſtians, and by the Gentiles to the Daemons? and having ſaid that they erect no Altars to them as the heathens did for ſacrifice, but ſacrificed to God alone, he adds, that <hi>at this ſacrifice the Martyrs</hi> were <hi>not invocated</hi> (as the Gentile Daemons were) <hi>but only nominated?</hi> now what is it to his purpoſe to tell us they are not invocated at the Altar, if they were invocated elſewhere? well then your laſt refuge is the invocation of Latria which Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> muſt be thought to ſpeak of;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 21.</note> becauſe he tells, us in his twentieth Book againſt <hi>Fauſtus Manichaeus,</hi> that they do not worſhip the Saints with <hi>Latria.</hi>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Doth he not ſay <hi>non invocantur, ſed nominantur?</hi> now I hope your invocation is not nomination, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſomewhat above it, and conſequently ſomewhat comprehended in that which he oppoſeth to it; ſo likewiſe, in the place you cite, he tells us they afforded that <hi>cultum dilectionis,</hi> and ſuch as was given to holy men, that were now alive; yea, ſaith he, we ſound forth their praiſes, but we do not worſhip them with <hi>Latria;</hi> where albeit <hi>Fauſtus</hi> there objected that they worſhipped them <hi>votis ſimilibus,</hi> with ſuch prayers or vows as the heathens worſhipped their Idols with, yet could he not get Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they prayed unto them at all; but having told us that they praiſed them, there he ſtops and riſeth no higher, albeit the objection, and the buſineſs in hand (which was to ſhew what honour the Saints did receive from them, and what they thought not fit to yield unto them) did require it. Thus have we returned an Anſwer to our Authours pleas from Scripture and Antiquity: our next work ſhould be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to them thoſe many arguments by which our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions do confute this ſuperſtition, and plead the cauſe of Chriſt againſt them; but I ſhall wave it at preſent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with evidencing the judgement, and practice of Antiquity to run contrary to them.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> It is a ſtrong preſumption that this Invocation of Saints is not ſo pious, ſo profitable, as the <hi>Trent</hi> Council doth imagine, in that we find neither precept, nor example of all the Fathers of the Old Teſtament, whereby this kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to them may be warranted?</p>

<label type="milestone">

               <p>
                  <q>The queſtion muſt bee,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 204.</note> whether a perpetual abſtinence from Marriage, and <hi>all Carnal luſts,</hi> may lawfully by Prieſts be made the matter of a vow; and tells us, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the practiſe, at leaſt conſider'd, as extending it ſelf generally, to any whole order or ſtate of men, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally any obligation impoſed on them to this practiſe: On
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:107126:140"/>the contrary he tells us, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> enjoins Celibacy to Prieſts, and holds that 'tis ſuch a gift, that is denied to none, that rightly ſeek it, and therefore may bee made the matter of a vow:</q> Agreeably to their <hi>Trent</hi> Council, which tells us, <hi>Deus id recte petentibus non deneget.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here (to omit his ſtating the queſtion of Carnal luſts) are two differences betwixt us.</p>
               <p n="1">1 They ſay, all may have this gift of Continence, who rightly ſeek it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That it is lawful to impoſe ſuch an obligation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Celibacy upon their Prieſts; both which we deny.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> that this is not a gift to bee attained by every man, appears abundantly from the 7. <hi>chap. of the</hi> 1 <hi>Ep. Cor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which, the firſt Queſtion moved, is, <hi>Whether a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhould embrace a Conjugal eſtate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this 'tis Anſwered,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 1. It is good for a man not to touch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> That (as the caſe ſtood then) 'twas very commendable for a man, ſo to moderate his affections, and get ſuch a noble victory over the fleſh, as not to need this remedy; <hi>('tis good for a man not to touch a Wife.)</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) or retain her, if he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured her, and every woman her proper Husband; or if ſhe be a Virgin, ſubmit to the bond of Matrimony; and when the Conjugal knot ſhall once be tyed, and they be under this relation of Man and Wife (ſince avoiding Fornication was the cheif motive to this condition) let due benevolence be mutually given; for the woman not having any longer power over her own body, cannot without open fraud deny it, when moderately deſired: And in proſecution of the ends of Marriage (which reaſon equally concerns the Husbands body) unleſs it be by the interceding of ſome ſuch Cautions as theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That it be with the mutual conſent of both.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That it bee in ſome rare and extraordinary caſe; <hi>viz.</hi> in time of Faſting, or being importunate with God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:107126:140"/>
               <p n="3">3 Thatſuchſeparation be not long. And theſe cautions are neceſſary to be obſerved, leaſt <hi>Satan,</hi> who will neglect no opportunity, do enſnare you; and by reaſon of your defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in this gift of Continence, prevail upon you, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the flames of unclean deſires. Yet would I not here ſeem to enjoyn all married ſtate, or a continual uſe of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age bed, neither do I ſpeak this as a precept to all, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the incontinent. For verily I could be glad that the Divine bounty (if it were his pleaſure) would afford this gift of Continence, <hi>he hath given me,</hi> to every Chriſtian; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his infinite wiſdome hath thought meet that it ſhould be otherwiſe, and that this gift (as others which according to his pleaſure are diſtributed) ſhould be peculiar to ſome; my deciſion is, that 'twere more commodious for Widdows and Virgins (if they could contain) to live in Celibacy, <hi>as I do.</hi> But if they finde it otherwiſe, then doth a neceſſity lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, either to enter into the ſtate of Matrimony, or to burn; and therefore to extinguiſh theſe flames, they muſt uſe this means to prevent it, which God hath appointed for this end.</p>
               <p>This Paraphraſe is clear and evident, yet will I further evince, what ever can be denied in it by the obſtinate.</p>
               <p>Do they tell us, in anſwer to the 2 <hi>verſe,</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of perſons already married? I aſſent; do they tell us it is a counſel? I ſay ſo alſo, only minding them that thence, according to their doctrine, unavoidably it will follow, that it is of greater virtue and merit, for every one to have his own wife, then not.</p>
               <p>Will <hi>Bellarm.</hi> add, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Fornication, not uſtions; I muſt minde him, that the Apoſtle determines very plainly, that 'tis better to marry then to burn.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That theſe luſtful motions and ſtimulations, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intends by uſtion, muſt needs be ſins, for according to our Saviours rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. <hi>They are ſpiritual Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Is it farther ſaid, that this concerns thoſe that have not made this vow of Continence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Muſt not others then avoid Fornication? may they defraud each others? or if ſingle, may they live in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs?
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:107126:141"/>or refuſe to marry though they be not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? muſt a vow be the bond to manifeſt iniquity?</p>
               <p>Secondly, If any obſtinately deny my interpretation of due benevolence, for the uſe of the body; the reaſon aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will confute them; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Husband hath not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his own body, &amp;c. and that they muſt not defraud each other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That by Prayer <hi>verſe</hi> 5. is underſtood <hi>accurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or precatio,</hi> as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> there hath it, or ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ingagement in that duty, is evident from it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with faſting, it's limitation to a time, it's exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the marriage bed, and laſtly, the charge of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, to return to Cohabitation, when 'tis ended.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus evinced,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> from the 2 <hi>verſe,</hi> I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus. If it be a neceſſary means for the avoiding Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to procure or uſe a Wife, then all have not, nor can have the gift of Continence, but the former is true from the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> for he doth not ſay, let them faſt and pray, and vow Continence, but let them uſe the remedy God appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whence 'tis obvious to conclude, that this was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy neceſſary for <hi>ſome,</hi> to avoid Fornication, which could not be, if <hi>all</hi> may attain to the gift of Continence.</p>
               <p>From the 5 <hi>verſe,</hi> thus. If abſtinence from the marriage bed, even in thoſe, that are engaged in faſting and prayer, muſt be but for a time, and that leaſt Satan prevail upon them to incontinence, then will not the uſe of means bee ſufficient to procure the gift to all; (For what means more available then faſting and prayer?) But the firſt is evident from the words of the Apoſtle, and therefore the conſequence of it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p>From the 8 <hi>verſe,</hi> thus. That which is a proper gift, and that upon this account, becauſe it pleaſeth the Divine boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to afford it ſome, and not to others, cannot be common to all, though never ſo diligent in the uſe of means (ſeeing it cannot bee procured by any, to whom 'tis not the good pleaſure of God to give it) but ſuch is the gift of Continence.</p>
               <p>From the 10th <hi>verſe,</hi> thus. The Apoſtle ſaith to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married and widdows, if they cannot contain let them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; therefore he ſuppoſes that all cannot have this gift of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency.</p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:107126:141"/>
               <p>Again <hi>verſe</hi> 25. The Apoſtle tells us, in theſe indifferent matters, I have no precept, but yet my counſel is, that Virgins and Widdows would abſtain from Marriage (if they have the gift of Continence) as being a condition, in which they are more free from the combrances of the world, and will finde leſs impediments of an holy life: this therefore I ſpeak, conſulting their good; but by no means would I lay a neceſſity on them to imbrace this Celibacy, for this would be a certain way to caſt a ſnare on them. The impoſition of ſuch a Yoke, without the leaſt reſpect unto their power of Continency, or the want thereof, would prove ſuch a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual perplexity, that I think it neceſſary to decline, even the very ſuſpitions of it.</p>
               <p>Now from hence I argue, if all may have this gift of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, then would it not be a ſnare to impoſe it (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it was ſo exceedingly more Eligible) but the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſo eſteems it: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Verſe.</hi> 37. Thus: if the Apoſtle ſaith, if need ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite, that a Virgin marry, let her do it, ſhee ſinneth not. and <hi>Hieron. in locum. ſi ſentiat Carnem, &amp;c.</hi> If ſhe be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of the too much prevailing of the fleſh, that it doth <hi>Ebullire in libidinem,</hi> is not to be kept back by the <hi>Bridle</hi> of Continency, but ſhe muſt either marry, or fall; Then hath not every one the gift of Continency; But this they evidently aſſert, <hi>ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here our <hi>Author</hi> hath ſomewhat to ſay in anſwer to us (I ſuppoſe.) For having told us, that we deny Celibacy,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> may lawfully be made the matter of a vow, generally to any whole order, or ſtate of men, upon ſuppoſition, that 'tis a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial gift of God (as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7.) not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on all:
<note place="margin">P. 205. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <q>well <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> 'tis <hi>granted</hi> that <hi>'tis a gift of God, the fruit of his Holy Spirit, and cannot by natural means be obtained,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>ſo as to be practiſed in obedience to him, but</hi> (then he replies with his Maſter <hi>Stapleton, Antid. p.</hi> 280) ſo are all <hi>vertues, ſo is faith, ſo is repentance, ſo is charity; all which notwithſtanding we vow in our Baptiſm, and why do we vow a practice of theſe vertues, which are pure gifts of God? Becauſe we are aſſured, the ſame God, who commanded that vow, will not be wanting to ſupply ſtrength to perform it, in all thoſe
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:107126:142"/>that ſincerely beg thoſe gifts of him, by earneſt prayer, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all known, and poſſible to be avoided impediments to the practice of theſe vertues.</hi> But (1) This would never have made a ſhew of any anſwer, had not the word <hi>ſpecial,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole ſtreſſe of our argument conſiſts, been <hi>Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> left out. (2) As it is, it hath received two anſwers, from <hi>Pareus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Notes upon Cor. p. 379.</note> who tells his <hi>Stapleton,</hi> that there is a manifeſt diſparity. (1) Becauſe the vow of Baptiſm is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, and cannot be neglected without ſin, but as for perpetual Celibacy, it hath no command, for if it had, it would not be a Counſel, as our <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> contends. Well therefore, ſeeing God hath commanded the one vow ſhould be made, and not commanded ſo much as the <hi>matter</hi> of the other, there is not the ſame reaſon ſurely for the exerciſe of both. (2) <hi>Saith</hi> he, the obedience we promiſe in our vow of Baptiſm is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> enjoyned on all upon pain of <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and albeit the performance of that vow exceed our natural ſtrength, yet God hath promiſed that he will give that faculty and grace, which ſhall enable us to perform it; but the vow of perpetual Celibacy, is neither commanded to all, nor is it given to all <hi>[ex parte dei]</hi> nor hath it the promiſe of God, that it ſhall be ſo. Now then wee ſay, to whom God commands this vow, aſſuredly hee will give ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, but to ſuppoſe, that hee hath done it to all, is the moſt <hi>ridiculous begging of the queſtion imaginable,</hi> yea it makes the marriage of all men ſinful, as being contrary to Gods Command of a vow of Celibacy, and it makes the Celibacy of Prieſts, <hi>jure divino,</hi> which our Author dares not aver.</p>
               <p>But our Author hath an Argument <hi>againſt himſelf,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But let us ſee how he will prove,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> that this gift is beſtowed on <hi>very many,</hi> and in ſome caſes, is neceſſary to almoſt <hi>all.</hi> (1) Then he brings us an Argument of <hi>Maldonates,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.11, 82.</note> to prove the Apoſtle cannot ſo be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, forſooth becauſe he forbids marriage to Widdows, who had conſecrated themſelves to the Lords ſervice. Now that he for bids them, 'tis argued.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he bids
<q>the Church Governours refuſe them, leſt they ſhould marry.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <q>He calls this marriage a caſting off their firſt faith, as all the Fathers Interpret it, and tells them that it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their damnation.

               <p n="1">1. Then the learned <hi>Camero</hi> tells us,

For the Apoſtle diſcourſeth of ſuch Widdows, who had devoted themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Church, promiſing the performance of thoſe Offices, which were proper for perſons ſo devoted; Now ſeeing there was no legitimate pretence for ſuch as were ſo addicted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the further performance of theſe Offices, but the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of marriage. When they began <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which as <hi>Heſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> tells us, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to wax inſolent and weary of this miniſtry to the Church (partly for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and partly for the ſeeming vileneſſe of it,) that they might become free, they did pretend neceſſity of marriage as a covert of their pride and floath.</p>
               <p>That therefore which the Apoſtle reproves in them is not their marriage, but the uſing of it as the veil of their idleneſs, and thence it is, that he accuſes them, firſt of their inſolency in vilifying that Miniſtry, in which they were ingaged. And
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:107126:147"/>herein is the wiſdome of the Apoſtle Conſpicuous, that leaſt he ſhould ſeem to condemn ſimply the <hi>marriage</hi> of ſuch, He firſt ſhews wherein they had offended; <hi>viz.</hi> not in that they married, but that they did ſo out of ſuch an end, as knowing that ſuch a pretence only, was a juſt cauſe of rejecting the burden they had caſt upon them; (For it could not be, that ſhe who was not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> but at the power of her Husband, could bee able to perform the office of a <hi>Deaconeſs,</hi> as then was requiſite.) Now this interpretation is evidently contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to that of the Papiſts, but that it is the truth, I offer this Argument to evince. Either the Apoſtle inveighs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>pretence</hi> of Marriage in theſe younger widdows, or againſt their Marriage; Not the latter, therefore the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. That it is not the latter I prove, becauſe the Apoſtle bids them marry. <hi>Juniores volo nubere,</hi> Verſe 14. You will ſay with the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> that he ſpeaks of other widdows, that had not yet enter'd into the Churches ſervice, not of thoſe which had made this promiſe.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſw.</hi> It muſt be extended to them alſo; as may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that he requires that widdows ſhould be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, which condition could not well agree to <hi>younger</hi> wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, who were in danger of having <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for doing that which is blame-worthy, in violating ſuch a promiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He would have ſuch widdows refuſed, which were in danger to wax wanton againſt Chriſt, to marry and ſo violate their promiſe to the Church; but ſuch were thoſe <hi>younger</hi> widdows which had made this promiſe, <hi>Verſe</hi> 11, 12. Nor can it here be ſaid, that it could not be free for them to go back from their promiſe.</p>
               <p>For 1. There can be no reaſon aſſigned of ſuch an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing it muſt be made with this <hi>tacit</hi> limitation, <hi>if the Church will accept them,</hi> and therefore if the Church ſee cauſe to refuſe them, they are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> abſolved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be it, they had vowed (which cannot be proved) yet that vow cannot be obligatory to performance, which puts a perſon in a real danger of waxing wanton againſt Chriſt, of having the condemnation of violating his firſt faith; it being abſolutely unlawful for any one to continue in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:107126:147"/>and contrary to the Apoſtles precept, of abſtaining from all appearance of evil; and therefore ſuch a vow made to binde one in ſuch a ſtate, is a bond of iniquity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Null.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle would have ſuch widdows refuſed, who were in danger to be idle tatlers, buſie bodies, wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, &amp;c. but ſuch were younger widdows, already made <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coneſſes,</hi> verſe 13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle would have things ſo managed, as that no occaſion might be given to the Adverſary, to ſpeak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully; but this could not be, if younger widdows, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>Deaconeſſes</hi> ſhould not be refuſed as well as others, <hi>Verſe</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Apoſtle would have that altered, which might be an occaſion of turning young women aſide unto Satan, but ſuch was the keeping of them in that condition, and had been already, as the Apoſtle tells us; <hi>v.</hi> 15. For <hi>ſome</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of theſe young Widdows) are already turned aſide unto Satan: But you will ſay, that the Apoſtle plainly ſaith, they are therefore blame worthy, becauſe they have left their firſt Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſw.</hi> 1. They are therefore blame-worthy, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, out of Pride, Sloath, and Inſolency, they have broken their Faith. (Not if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they had left this office) as being ſuppoſed to have made this promiſe only upon condition, of the continuance of the gift of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency; ſeeing to make it abſolutely, we have proved unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By firſt Faith, we may underſtand the Faith they took upon them, when they firſt became Chriſtians; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it bindes them not to be inſolent, but humble, and ready to do the meaneſt office of love to their fellow-members; not to be ſloathful, but to bee diligent in Gods ſervice; They that are guilty of theſe crimes, may bee ſaid to have made <hi>Null</hi> their Faith, ſeeing it will be of no vertue nor efficacy to their ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others have long ago anſwered, that the Apoſtle is to be underſtood not of any promiſe made to the Church, but to God or Chriſt, upon their entrance into Chriſtianity, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:107126:148"/>tell us, that theſe women having (haply moved with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their Husbands death) caſt themſelves into the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Widdows, and afterward finding themſelves not to have the gift of Continence, but to want the remedy of Marriage, leaſt they ſhould be branded with the note of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, inconſtancy, and lightneſs in departing from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; they choſe rather to fall off from Chriſt unto Gentiliſm and Marry, whence they are condemned of forſaking their firſt Faith; not ſimply, in that they would Marry, but that they would do it <hi>cum abnegatione fidei, &amp; Chriſtianae religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay, if they had a minde to Marry, what neceſſity of doing it with</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Pagans?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe had they Married to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they would continually have been twited by them for their levity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy; for their negligence in the office of the Church, gadding abroad, &amp;c. yea, and being ſuch, could ſcarce hope to procure a Husband among them, and therefore that they might not fail of them, and that they might live more free from theſe taunts and diſgraces, they rejected their office and faith together: Now that they did ſo, as it is probable from the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies, <hi>excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere habenas Chriſti;</hi> ſo is it more then ſo from the 15 <hi>v.</hi> which tells us, that they had turned aſide to Satan; a phraſe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſed to denote Apoſtacy from Chriſt and God: For as turning from the power of Satan to God, is a deſcription of turning Chriſtian; ſo Apoſtates are ſaid to be transfer'd again into Satans Kingdome. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. And to turn <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>John.</hi> 6.66. as here <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Laſtly, That it cannot be underſtood of a ſolemn vow of Continency, joyned with an abnegation of the married ſtate, beſide, what I have ſaid before is proved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the Apoſtle denies that he would caſt a ſnare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any, that is, lay a neceſſity on them to contain unmarried; but on the contrary gives this general <hi>axiom, that it is better to marry than to burn.</hi> And therefore it is altogether unlikely, that he would now tell them, that they muſt continue, though he
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:107126:148"/>found they had not the gift of Continence, under pain of damnation. No, rather he would have admoniſhed them to repent of their raſh vow, and told them with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiph. de tradit.</note> (who is clearly <hi>ours</hi> as to this) that it is better to have the guilt of <hi>one ſin, viz.</hi> a raſh vow, then of <hi>many, viz.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual burnings. Calling the firſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, or that which will bring damnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the vow of Continence be the firſt faith here ſpoken of, then may not any woman or widdow make this vow by the Apoſtles charge, till ſhe be ſixty years old,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Seſs.</hi> 25. <hi>C.</hi> 15.</note> which how is it this day practized in the Romiſh Church, ſince the <hi>Trent Councel</hi> admits them at ſixteen? Let them then confeſs, that this Text ſpeaks not of votaries, or elſe that they ſin againſt the Apoſtles precept, by warrant of their <hi>infallible general Council.</hi> For it is evident, the Apoſtle bids them not admit a Widdow under ſixty, for fear of her incontinency, and for that reaſon requires them to refuſe thoſe that are youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then ſo: I confeſſe beſides, <hi>Bellarm:</hi> who is very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and every where confuted, <hi>Eſtius</hi> tells us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is not the ſame reaſon for Widdows, as for Virgins; For theſe having not felt the pleaſure of due bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, are not ſo much tempted, as Widdows; But to this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is evident, you admit even Widdows, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, yea at any time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeing marriage was ordained for the abating of this fire of luſt, ſure it will ſomewhat do ſo, not more inflame it, and it is unconceivable that women, though thirty or forty, once marryed, ſhould bee more prone to luſt, then thoſe of ſixteen or eighteen, never Marryed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be it, that there were ſome difference, yet ſurely not ſuch as will put Virgins out of danger; eſpecially when the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. that there may bee need, and therefore he will not put a ſnare upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hee tells us, that they had no Cloiſters to bee immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in then, as there be now, and therefore they were more obnoxious to this failing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By no means, when it muſt be granted that Church
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:107126:149"/>Diſcipline was more ſtrict then, Chriſtianity more lively, and better practized then now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Solitarineſs doth not help this diſeaſe, but increaſe it rather.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That their Cloiſters do not abridge them of occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of luſt, appears by their frequent pregnancy, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited Authors; neither ought they to change the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles precept, upon ſuch ſleight and frivolous grounds. In a word, to conclude, why may not this ſenſe of the words paſs for currant? you admit younger Widdows into this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon their promiſe of continuing in that eſtate, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las they are in danger to wax wanton againſt Chriſt by this means, and when they have done ſo, to marry, which courſe of yours will bring condemnation upon them. This waxing wanton, being an evident breach of the promiſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Commands of Chriſt, which they made at their entrance into Chriſtianity. And whereas he tells us, that his <hi>Expoſition,</hi> (which makes it plead for their vow of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency) is not <hi>contradicted by any</hi> of the Antient Doctors: Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> will tell him, p. 725.
<q>I had thought I had read in Holy <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> wo to you, that make void the firſt faith of Baptiſm. I thought that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had ſaid in the preface to the <hi>Ep.</hi> to <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </q> They are not worthy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, <hi>qui primam fidem Baptiſmi irritam fecerunt,</hi> who have made void their <hi>firſt faith</hi> in Baptiſm. Now if a contrary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation be not a contradiction to the ſenſe contended for, I may ſay as well that the Interpretation of theſe two Fathers was never contradicted by any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>But it is the conſent of antiquity in which our Adverſary vaunts himſelf.

And ſeeing God ſtrictly requires us to avoid this guilt, he muſt conſequently enjoyn us to lye, to live in continual Hypocriſie, and diſobedience to his will, (as being neceſſary to this end) albeit he hath every where denounced damnation upon perſons guilty of theſe crimes, which is horribly blaſphemous.

That he who ſends them to the Law, and to the teſtimonies, telling them, that thoſe who ſpeak contrary unto them, have no truth in them; ſhould yet oblige the ſame perſons, upon the utmoſt penalty, to embrace deciſions contrary to theſe laws and teſtimonies, as the truths of God. <hi>Credat Judae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Apella.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, you ſeparated from the purer part of your own Church, which then as to the main was Orthodox. Again, might not the <hi>Arrians</hi> have argued thus,

               <p>Well then in a word, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a power to excommunicate thoſe who deſert her, and tranſgreſſe her Laws, even as the Magiſtrate hath a power to inflict a mulct or penalty, upon ſuch as tranſgreſs his laws and ſanctions; but then, as the exertion of this power upon perſons innocent, or in proſecution of Laws which are manifeſtly unjuſt, is a tranſgreſſion of the bounds and limits of this power, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in the perſon that thus exerts it, even ſo the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication uſed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon other Churches, who are neceſſitated by the law of God to forſake her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and only tranſgreſs her laws, when inconſiſtent with the obſervance of the laws of Chriſt, is a tranſgreſſion of the bounds and limits of her power, and criminal, not in him that ſeparates (but in them that make this ſeparation) he being bound to obey God rather then man, ſo that 'tis impoſſible for you to juſtifie your Excommunications, unleſs you can juſtifie your laws and tyrannical exactions, upon the conſciences of men.</p>

Again, the Myriads of <hi>Jews</hi> that beleived in Chriſt, and yet were zealous of the law, were guilty of this crime, as requiring ſuch conditions of their communion, which they ought not to have required, and excluding men from it, upon terms unequal; and yet to ſay that all theſe Myriads (who through weakneſs and infirmity, thus erred) did periſh, and that their beleiving in Chriſt, ſerved them to no other ends, but in the infinity of their torments, to upbraid them with Hypocriſie and Hereſie, is ſo harſh a ſpeech, that I ſhould not be very haſty to pronounce it: Yea further, let but a man conſider the variety of mens principles, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and educations, tempers, and diſtempers, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, degrees of light, and underſtanding, the many ſeveral determinations that are made, even by moſt Churches, the various judgements of the moſt learned, touching many of them; I ſay, let theſe things be conſidered, and then let any

               <p n="2">2.

                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:107126:167"/>and albeit the diſſolution of the other Union bee a ſin, yet that it is not damnable ſeems evident to mee, in that God ſure hath not made it as a neceſſary condition of eternal life to believe this ſubordination of Governours, in which this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſts, and that hee hath not done ſo I conclude, becauſe it is no where ſo manifeſtly revealed to us that the meaneſt capacity may apprehend it.

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> you argue thus, the Schiſmatick is divided from the body of Chriſt, and ſo from Chriſt himſelf, and therefore is inevitably damned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This diviſion from the body of Chriſt is twofold, either in things in which it is abſolutely neceſſary to be united, and hee that is thus divided is neceſſarily cut off from Chriſt, and muſt bear his burthen; or in theſe things in which it is not abſolutely neceſſary to bee united, as in the ſame Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, or Ceremonies, the ſame opinions, as to matters not fundamental, in which it is as impoſſible to obtain a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſent, as in the lineaments of our faces; Now to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that a Schiſm in ſuch matters, by reaſon of the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are incident to humane frailty ſhould preſently
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:107126:167"/>cut off our weak Brother from the body of Chriſt, is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that God requires upon pain of damnation, that a man ſhould truely judge of that which many thouſands even of learned men very differently decide, and which is ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely revealed, if at all it be ſo, as that the moſt piercing intellects dare not peremptorily aſſert, they have found the truth; Thus whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the onely Orthodox Church of Chriſt? whether a general council may erre, and whether the Pope bee the ſupreme Paſtor of the Church of Chriſt, are queſtions which extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Church of God. You affirm all this, the Proteſtants and Eaſtern Churches contradict you. Arguments are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on both ſides from Scripture, Reaſon, and Antiquity. Now that it ſhould here bee neceſſary, for all the Eaſtern Churches, all the Churches of the Proteſtants, upon pain of Damnation to deſert their own opinions, and embrace what you obtrude upon them, when you ſhall bee able to demonſtrate and I ſee it done, I ſhall not deſpair of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to evince that ſnow is black, or to be convinced of any the moſt amazing Paradox.</p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay that the Schiſm of ignorant ſouls ſeems to be more contradictory to <hi>humane</hi> reaſon,

                        <hi>Mr. C. p.</hi> 229.</note> and conſequently the preferring of their own conduct, or the conduct of particular Churches, before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal authority of the Church,</hi> (For what you add of their Excommunicating the whole Church, both Paſtors and flocks as Heathens, and Publicans, it is ſo impertinent as nothing can bee more) <hi>is a preſumption ſo contrary to humane nature and reaſon,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 230.</note> as that their want of learning is that which will moſt condemn them. And this you ſpeak not of perſons abſolutely Idiots, but ſuch as</hi> diſcourſe of matters of Religion, and <hi>paſſe their judgements on them.</hi> Now here do you not ſuppoſe, that to reject your Doctrines is to reject the Univerſal Authority of the Church, which wee are not very likely to acknowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are ſuch perſons bound to conform their judgements, to the moſt or not? If not, why do you trouble us with this Argument; If ſo, then in the times of <hi>Arrianiſme</hi> they were
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:107126:168"/>bound to deny the divinity of our Saviour, and under the Old Teſtament, when Idolatry prevailed, they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (unleſs they would do things contrary to humane nature and common reaſon) to become Idolaters, and ſeeing the Rulers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> believed not on Chriſt, but rejected him as a Blaſphemer, the people were bound to do ſo too; theſe and a thouſand ſuch like abſurdities, are the very natural conſequences of your poſitions.</p>

The Pope hath confirmed this, <hi>Ergo</hi> 'tis true; this Council was approved by the Pope, <hi>Ergo</hi> 'tis infallible; but there is not one ſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be heard in all Antiquity of this nature.</p>
               <p>Again, if the Pope muſt be included, may not the Pope and Council run counter, and what ſhall wee do then? what ſhall we do in a time of Schiſm? when there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:107126:170"/>pretenders to the Popedome, as frequently there have been; to whom then muſt we hearken? how ſhall we know which of theſe is the true Pope? if a Council muſt decide it (as indeed none elſe can) either the Council is fallible, and may determine wrong, or infallible, and then it is ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pope: And ſo the aſſertion I diſpute againſt, is deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and another taken up, of which anon.</p>
               <p>Again, ſuppoſe any Popes miſdemeanours be to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, as for example; whether <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> got into St. <hi>Peters</hi> chair by Simony, in this caſe the Pope cannot bee Judge, and therefore if the Council without the Pope be not infallible, how can wee know whether their determination bee aright, ſeeing it may as well bee wrong; Further tell me, how may I be aſſured that the Pope is a true Pope? If he came in by Simony, he is none, and how is it poſſible for me to know that? ſeeing ſome have been Simonaical, how can I be certain that many others have not been ſo too? and if ſo, then not only all fallibility is ceaſed, but your ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion too. For all the Cardinals created by a Simonaical Pope, can be no Cardinals, and if ſo, then <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> being evidently convicted of Simony before the Council of <hi>Sicil,</hi> could be no Pope, his Cardinals, no Cardinals; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Popes, created ſince by thoſe Cardinals, bee truly ſuch; ſo that from his time, your Church hath been without a lawful univerſal head.</p>
               <p>Again, how ſhall I bee certain, that the Popes election is legal (for, unleſs it be ſo, your ſelves deny him to be Pope) when ſometimes the <hi>People,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Clergy</hi> choſe him, ſometimes both; in one age the Emperour, in another the Cardinals, in a third a General Council: Further I might ask you, how you are aſſured the Pope is rightly ordained and Baptiz'd (for if he was not, by your own principles, hee can be no Pope) and that he was, I cannot be certain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I could know the intention of the Prieſt that Baptized him, and the Biſhop that ordained him: and though I did know (what cannot be known) their intentions, yet how ſhall I know the intentions of the perſons, that Baptized and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them; and ſo on to that endleſs chain of uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, propounded by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> in his ſecond <hi>chap.</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:107126:170"/>which 'tis impoſſible you ſhould ever bee able to ſolve. But I am oppreſt with copiouſneſſe of Argument, and therefore muſt break off from this member to the next.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, therefore if you ſay,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> that the council is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible without the Pope. Then</p>

                     <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>ſect</hi> 8.</note> You contradict your ſelf in requiring the conſent of the Pope to the Obligation of the Councils Canons; for if they be infallible, are we not bound to aſſent to them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? Or can we do well in oppoſing what is infallible?</p>
               <p n="2">2. How ſhall wee know, whether the Pope or Council be ſupreme, when the council of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it one way, the council of <hi>Lateran</hi> the other way? So, the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> aſſerted the corporeity of Angels, the firſt of <hi>Lateran</hi> denies it. Can infallible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons contradict each other?</p>
               <p>Who muſt bee the Members of this Council? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely Biſhops, or Presbyters, and Deacons too? up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what certain account, do you ſhut out Presbyters, if you admit onely Biſhops? or if you require, that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be called to the Council, what certain grounds can you produce for it? Why ſhould you exclude Laymen from a place in theſe your Councils? eſpecially, when the Scripture tells us, that in the Council which was called about circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, mention is made not onely of Apoſtles, but of the Elders of the Church, and of the Brethren. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.23. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> Saith indeed, that this multitude was called not to conſent, and judge, but onely to conſent. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what authority doth hee build this interpretation? Or what certainty can we have in the determinations of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? If we may thus apply unto them our idle fancies, add and diſtinguiſh, where no other Scripture, no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or context leads us to it, but rather the contrary ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is inſinuated; for as much as the definitive ſentence runs thus; It hath pleaſed the Apoſtles, and Elders, with the whole Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, why muſt Biſhops bee called to it out of one Countrey and not our of another? why will ſo many out of this Kingdome ſuffice? What if the members of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil be choſen illegally, and by a certain faction, ſo that the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:107126:171"/>major part of thoſe that were capable of being Members of the Council, bee of a contrary opinion to the perſons actually elected? Why ſhould wee believe them then? For if the contrary faction ſhould prevail, their determinations would bee contradictory to the others, and ſo the Articles of our faith muſt bee formed by chance and faction. Again, what if all the perſons called come not, will the Council be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall? Why may not the greater part of the Council erre, and yet the Church be infallible? as well as the greateſt part of its Members diffuſed erre, and yet the diffuſed Church be infallible? Eſpecially ſeeing Gods promiſes muſt bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to concern them both? Shall they bee infallible, whether they faſt, pray, ſtudy, and uſe means, or not?

Yea ſeeing the packing and fore-reſolution of votes doth null their Decrees, (or elſe your Anſwer to the Canon of the Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is perfectly vain) in ſuch a corrupt age as wee live in,

VVhat if there can bee no general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? VVhat if Princes will not ſuffer Biſhops within their Dominions to repair to it?

               <p n="1">1. 'Tis evident, wee never had a general Council; For what Biſhop came in the primitive times from <hi>India, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, Perſia, Parthia, Armenia,</hi> what <hi>Brittiſh</hi> or <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Biſhops were there? And</p>

               <p n="1">1. To return anſwer to his evidence from Scripture, that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. from the 8. to the 13. is very unſerviceable to his deſign; For not to tell him with <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi>

               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:107126:172"/>
               <p n="1">1. It is not evident from the place, that any mention is made of Religious cauſes; for albeit there bee mention of cauſe and cauſe; yet in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which ſignifies a cauſe before brought to the inferiour Judges <hi>V.</hi> 8. before whom the cauſes of Religion were not brought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their judgement was not infallible is evident. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture affirms of theſe Prieſts, who are here appointed to Judge, that they departed out of the way, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many to ſtumble at the Law, yea, corrupted the covenant of <hi>Levi. Mal.</hi> 2.8.9. They accepted perſons in that Law, that is in judging, the law was wreſted by them in favour of perſons whom they particularly affected; yea further, theſe Judges condemned the Prophets of the Lord,
<note place="margin">Jer. 26.8. The prieſts, Prophets, and all the people condemn <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> to death.</note> and that for accuſing the people and Prieſts of defection from the Lord, to Idolatry; from the Precepts of the Law, to the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous ſins. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.17. Yea, they approved of falſe Prophets, as is every where extant in the Old-Teſtament; for that this was done by theſe Judges, appears, in that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was not to be Judged but by the <hi>Senate,</hi> whence Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.33. It cannot bee that a Prophet ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe it was the place where this <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Had it been ſo, why was it that ſo many ſects were found among them, of Sadduces, Phariſees, Eſſens, Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonites and Herodians? How is it, that this infallible Judge never went about to interpoſe his ſentence? How is it, that they never reſorted to him for ſatisfaction, but indeed theſe Sects were made up of the perſons that were to judge, and ſo no equal deciſion was like to bee made by ſuch intereſted perſons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee know that this Synod was made up of Sadduces and Phariſees, the one of which denied the Reſurrection; the other by their traditions annihillated the Command of God: Now theſe, as wee may read in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> mutually prevailed in the Nation; Now then, had this Synod been to judge of the Reſurrection, when the Sadduces prevailed, would they have been infallible in their Judgements. Surely no more then the <hi>Arrian</hi> Councils. And when the Phariſees, would they not (yea did they not) determine ſuch things
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:107126:172"/>which made void the Commandments of God? but what need wee flick upon theſe arguments, when wee have ſuch an illuſtrious inſtance, in their rejection of our Saviour, and refuſing to beleive on him; would the Synagogue have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to bee the Meſſias, when none of the Rulers thereof beleived on him, when <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was ſo twited by them, for offering to ſpeak for him? yea,
<note place="margin">P. 259.</note> did they not with their Preſident condemn him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.57. Oh! but (ſay they) Chriſt was now come, and their infallibility was ceaſed, and God now permited them to be deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But was it not neceſſary that they ſhould bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the will of God? for how elſe could the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate be accuſed, or the people for following their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? when the Senate by the vertue of this promiſe, as they interpret it, muſt needs ſuppoſe themſelves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in their judgement, and the people being bound alſo to eſteem them ſo, muſt neceſſarily aſſent to their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and had juſt cauſe to help forward his condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inſult over, crucifie and blaſpheme him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt accuſeth them of committing the like errour long before, in killing and condemning the Prophets ſent to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.35, 36. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 45. And <hi>Stephen,</hi> which of the Prophets have not your Fathers perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, ſlaying them, which ſhewed before, the coming of the juſt one; yea, our Saviour tells them, they were blinde guides, ſuch as would neither go into Heaven themſelves, nor permit others. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15, <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.</p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, was that in which <hi>Timothy</hi> converſed, and that was a particular Church (and that not the <hi>Roman</hi>) now ſuch you will not have to be infallible. That this is the very truth, is manifeſt from an impartial conſideration of the place; for the Apoſtle writeth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and giveth him directions, that he may know how to behave himſelf in the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> (and not the univerſal, in part of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, when he wrote this to him) and conſequently in a particular Church; Now the ſame Church in which he directeth him to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Apoſtle calls the Pillar and Ground of truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives this title to a particular Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Chill.</hi>
                  </note> Should wee grant you this on courteſie, yet muſt wee
<q>put you in remembrance, that many attributes are not notes of performance, but of duty, and teach us not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity what the thing or perſon is, but what it ſhould bee: Yee are the fait of the earth, faith our Saviour to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; not that this quality was inſeparable from their perſons, but becauſe it was their office to bee ſo; for if it
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:107126:173"/>could not have been otherwiſe, in vain had he put them in fear of being caſt upon the dunghil as unſavory, ſo the Church may be by duty the Pillar and Ground of all truth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, but profitable to ſalvation, and yet it may neglect and violate this duty, and be in fact, the teacher of ſome Errour.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſay, that this part of the verſe may bee connexed with the following, after this manner; The Pillar and Ground of truth, and without controverſie, great is the myſtery of Godlineſs; And that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſeems to have read it ſo; for in the beginning of his third book, hee tells us, that the Apoſtles had delivered to them the will of God, which they before had preached in the Scripture, to be the pillar and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Otherwiſe the Apoſtle would begin a new ſentence with a conjunction copulative, which is ſomewhat harſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to introduce thoſe doctrines of their Church, which were of greateſt moment and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, with ſuch a form as this is: thus <hi>Moſes Aegyptius</hi> in the beginning of that great work, which hee calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſpeaks thus: the foundation of foundations, and pillar of wiſdome, is the knowledge of the firſt and ſupreme being.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ſay, that if this alſo were allowed, yet muſt this ſentence be underſtood of the Church diffuſed, which will be alwaies the maintainer and teacher of all neceſſary truths (that being eſſential to her very being) not of a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, collected in a General Council.</p>
               <p>What hee adds farther, that <hi>our Saviour enjoyned obedience to all the commands of thoſe who ſate in</hi> Moſes <hi>his Chair,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſerviceable to him to prove an infallibility in the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How will it appear that he ſpeaks of them, conſidered as members of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and not rather as teachers in their Synagogues, in which caſe ſure they were not infallible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he plead for the infallibility of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he, the <hi>Shilo,</hi> was already come, the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> muſt bee held infallible after his coming, which (as it is contrary to Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s aſſertion in this very place, ſo it) laies a neceſſity on
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:107126:174"/>us to acknowledge, that either their decree againſt our Saviour was to bee believed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> or that to believe in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was no fundamental. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. This clauſe of yeilding obedience to the Scribes, and Phariſees, is to bee limited to what they taught from, and according unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; For elſewhere hee puts in a cave at againſt the doctrine of the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.6, 12. calls them blind guides, whom to follow would endanger our falling into the ditch, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.24. Seducers, <hi>V.</hi> 15. of this chapter; which is evidence ſufficient, that he never intended they ſhould be followed abſolutely, but only when they followed the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This infallibility cannot bee proved from reaſon, which to evince I will carefully ponder what Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath produced from this topick.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We acknowledge that this is the end of her decrees and that when ever her deciſions are Divine Truths, wee are under an Obligation to believe them, but to ſuppoſe they are alwaies ſuch, is evidently to beg the queſtion, and to aſſert this Obligation, when they are not ſuch, is to lay upon us a neceſſity to believe as many errours as it is poſſible for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to decide, which the experience of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> 2. <hi>Nicene,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> Council tells us may bee very many, and very dangerous.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> that <hi>God will not bee wanting to his Church to keep it in truth and unity;

                  </gap>nical, that is, it ought to be infallible: <hi>Anſ.</hi> But pray you ſir, do you not here apparently beg the queſtion? For if any of us thought that God would be wanting to preſerve his Church, in truth and unity, if General Councils were not infallible, how ſoon would wee embrace their infallibility? but this is it that we conſtantly deny, maintaining that albeit there be no ſuch infallible Judge, yet hath God ſufficiently conſulted the wel-fare of his Church, in that hee hath given us his Word as a Rule to walk by, and his Spirit who will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly guide his children into all ſaving truth: and indeed the Church whoſe unity we profeſſe, is not an Organical body, made of ſeveral particular Congregations, or provincial Churches, but onely conſiſts of the true and living members of Chriſts body, ſcattered through the world, which are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by faith, and the myſtical union of the Spirit, and to one another by the bond of charity, and are infallibly gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Spirit into a belief of all ſaving truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is evident hence that want of charity, prophaneneſs and Hypocriſie are as great breaches of the Churches unity, as want of truth, and yet I hope you will not accuſe God of being defective to his Church, becauſe he hath provided no other means then his Word, Spirit, and Miniſters, againſt theſe things; and why then ſhould we eſteem him ſo in not making further proviſion for the unity of his Church?</p>
               <p n="3">3. As God hath ſufficiently provided for Kingdomes and common-wealths, by his ordinance of Magiſtracy, albeit they bee not infallible in their Laws, but may ſometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſuch things as tend to the prejudice of their Subjects, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo hee hath ſufficiently provided for the external unity of the Church by the Eccleſiaſtical Governours hee hath placed in them, albeit they bee not ſo. But</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is an undeniable evidence that God doth not think theſe means ſo neceſſary to unity as you pretend, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee hath not at all acquainted us with this means of unity. For it cannot be that the Infinitely wiſe God, ſhould make that
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:107126:175"/>to bee the onely ſufficient means of unity, about the nature, and requiſites of which there bee ſo many hundred doubts, that the wiſeſt man is not able to reſolve them, or returne any thing ſatisfactory to them; Peruſe but the queſtions I have made touching this matter, unleſſe you are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them all with the greateſt perſpicuity and evidence, this means will evidently be uneffectual to the end that God intended it, for ſtill it will remain in <hi>dubio</hi> whether this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention have the conditions of a Judge infallible, ſeeing therefore it is evident, that moſt of the queſtions propoſed by mee are variouſly maintained by men of learning, and abilities, and it is as evident that God hath not interpoſed his deciſion touching any of them, it ſeems apparent unto mee, that he never intended a general Council as a Judge, to whoſe deciſions upon pain of damnation wee muſt aſſent, and to which wee muſt neceſſarily ſubmit our judgements, if wee would avoid the ruine of the Church; For ſure it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee that what is ſo neceſſary to the unity (that is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) of the Church, ſhould bee left by an all-wiſe God, at ſuch infinite uncertainties? And I appeal unto your ſelf, whether we who ſay the Scripture muſt bee Judge in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, or things neceſſary to Salvation, (as that God is, and that hee is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him, that hee is holy, juſt, and good, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, dyed for us, roſe again, will raiſe us up at the laſt day, and bring us unto judgement, that faith, repentance, and obedience, or holineſſe of life, are neceſſary for our attainment unto happineſſe) are at ſuch uncertainties. Hath not the Scripture laid down theſe things with the greateſt perſpicuity? Are they not writ as with a Sun beam? Is there any need of a general Council to determine theſe things? and muſt the Church undoubtedly be ruined if ſhee doth not? Now as for other things which may bee variouſly conceived and held, without the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of faith or good manners, a liberty of judgement may bee allowed, onely with ſuch reſtrictions as ſhall obviate all publick diſturbances of the Church. Nor doth it weaken this diſcourſe at all, that we are uncertain touching the number of fundamentals, ſeeing it cannot rationally bee denied that
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:107126:176"/>whatſoever is ſo, is perſpicuouſly laid down in Scripture, albeit we cannot ſay <hi>è contra,</hi> that whatever is perſpicuouſly laid down in Scripture is fundamental.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That a General Council is the whole Church, when as they cannot be the hundreth part even of the Miniſters of Gods Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if ſuch perſons thus convened, define any matter of Doctrine contrary to ſcripture, they muſt conſpire to do ſo, as if they could not define it out of weakneſs, raſhneſs, prejudice, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I <hi>Anſw.</hi> With Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his liberty of Propheſying</note> that either theſe Councils are tyed to the rule of Gods Word, or not; if the firſt, then are they to be examined by it; and to be followed no farther, then they adhere to this unerring Rule; and conſequently, we muſt be allowed a liberty of judgement, to diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they keep cloſe to this word, or not: If they are not tyed to the guidance of this Rule, then may they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs it, cancel the laws of Chriſt, and enact things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto, which even the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> diſclaim.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Unleſs we are bound to ſhut our eyes, <q>unleſs the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Council be ſo great a prejudice, as to make us do violence to our underſtanding, ſo as not to diſ-beleive it's decrees, though they ſeem clearly to be contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to beleeve they agree with the Rule of Scripture, though wee know not how; unleſs I ſay, we be bound in duty to bee ſo obediently blinde and ſottiſh; wee are ſure ſome Councils, which by our Adverſaries are reputed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, have notoriouſly receded from the words and ſenſe of Scripture. For what wit of man can reconcile the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the thirteenth Seſſion, of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> with Chriſts inſtitution, delivered to us by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; ſeeing in the preface of that decree, Chriſts inſtitution, and the practiſe of the Primitive Church is expreſſed, and then with a <hi>non obſtante,</hi> communion in one kind is eſtabliſhed.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Again, is it poſſible for any man to contrive a way to make the decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> friends with the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:107126:181"/>fourteenth chapter of the <hi>Corinthians?</hi> how do the <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſpiſtes</hi> of that Council ſweat, to reconcile it to St. <hi>Paul?</hi> and the wiſeſt of them do it ſo poorly, as to proclaim to all the world it is not feaſible. What vice in Scripture is prohibited with greater evidence, then this practiſe? and therefore on the ſame ſcore, that we are reconciled to ſuch decrees, we may be reconciled to the moſt groſs enormities. What ever is brought to prove the infallibility of Councils, cannot make it ſo certain that they are infallible, as theſe two inſtances do prove infallibly, that they were deceived, and if theſe were, others might have been.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>What ſhall we ſay to all the <hi>Arrian</hi> Councils, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with ſo great and numerous Aſſemblies, called by the authority of the Emperour, which at that time, did convocate all Synods, and to which, as many, or more did come, then to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council:</q> Is it neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that theſe have erred in matter of doctrine, and muſt it be unpoſſible to think the ſame of the leſs numerous aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, at the firſt and ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, or of the fifty Biſhops met at <hi>Trent?</hi>

               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:107126:183"/>
               <p>For the eviction of this, which is the main Pillar of our Authors Fabrick: I will premiſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſuch Councils are not infallible, this is evident from the contradictions of them to each other (thus the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> defined a General Council to be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Pope, that of <hi>Lateran</hi> the contrary, the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> decreed for Images, the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> contradicted that) from the evident errours deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by them (thus the corporiety of Angels, by that of <hi>Nice,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the <hi>Arrian</hi> Councils at <hi>Ariminum, Seleucia,</hi> and elſewhere) from the want of any promiſe of infallibility, from the appeals permitted from them to a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the correcting and nulling their decrees by that higher power, and many other things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſuch conventions of men thus fallible,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude Heretical opinions, and unlawful practiſes, upon the Churches, which are members of that Patriarchate; ſeeing they may and often do obtrude upon others, their decrees, which by reaſon of their fallibility, may bee Heretical and unjuſt: Yea further, the decrees of one Patriarchical Council, may be contradictory to another, and conſequently, if the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches of theſe Patriarchates, bee bound to aſſent unto them, they muſt bee bound to bee Schiſmaticks, even in the judgement of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> thus <hi>V. G.</hi> the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath decreed for communion in one kinde, celibacy of Prieſts, the worſhip of God in an unknown tongue, the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> for the ſupremacy of the Pope over a General Council; now let the Patriarcks of <hi>Conſtantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> and other of the Eaſtern Church, aſſemble ſuch a Council, would they not undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly decree the contrary to all theſe? and then according to Mr. C's. own rule, muſt not all the National Churches under them, be bound to contradict the decrees of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, and conſequently to be Schiſmaticks? yea, if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Churches may not examine the decrees of ſuch falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conventions, muſt they not lye under a neceſſity of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting any errour, or practiſing what ever they define, though never ſo contradictory to the law of God?</p>
               <p>Once more, it cannot be denied but that the <hi>Arrian</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:107126:184"/>at <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Seleucia,</hi> were at leaſt Patriarchical, or equivalent to ſuch, and will you add, that therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Province, from whence they were convened were bound to ſubmit to their determinations? You will ſay no, becauſe they contradicted the General Council held at <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, but doth not your Rule aſſure us, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer plenary Councils may be corrected by thoſe that follow, and were not the Biſhops at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> more numerous then thoſe at <hi>Nice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What if this of <hi>Ariminum</hi> had been aſſembled before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, muſt <hi>Arrianiſme</hi> then have commenced Orthodox? VVas there any impoſſibility but it might have been ſo? He that permitted <hi>Arrianiſme</hi> then to triumph, might have done it, if he pleaſed, in the former Centuries.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> is there any impoſſibility that the leſſer part of a Patriarchate ſhould bee Orthodox, and the greater Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and erronious? and ſticklers for that, which God hath contradicted in his Word? In this caſe may not any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſee whether a patriarchical Synod will encline, and muſt the Orthodox party then bee neceſſitated to convene when called to ſuch a Synod, and to aſſent to their determinations? and practiſe contrary to what God requires in his Word? Thus in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council matters ſtood, and they openly profeſſed they came to extirpate and condemn the <hi>Plaguy</hi> hereſie as they called it, of the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe things wee may ſee what we are to think of this axiom of our Antagoniſt,

                  <hi>viz. That if any law, cuſtome, or doctrine, in any Dioceſſe, bee diſcordant from, but eſpecially if it condemn, what is by Law in force,</hi> in the Province, or any <hi>Provincial law, what is in force in the Patriarchate, ſuch a law ought not to be made, or being made, ought to be repealed.</hi> Now apply theſe former inſtances to the Rule, and it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if any Province in the Eaſtern Churches ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſupremacy of the Pope, and decree Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one kind legitimate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They were bound to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch Doctrines and decrees, and conſequently bound to refuſe the conditions of Communion tendered to them by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus again, under the Old Teſtament, when the ten Tribes departed from the Worſhip of God in
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:107126:184"/>the place appointed by himſelf, and ſet up the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> it was unlawful for the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> to practiſe the contrary, much more to hold it unlawful ſo to tranſgreſs the Law of God, more yet to decree it to be ſo, and had the leſſer convention of twenty three determined for Chriſt, and held him the Meſſias that was to come, had they given him the veneration due unto him, yea, decreed it ſhould be ſo, all this muſt neceſſarily have been nulled by the contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the greater <hi>Sanhedrim?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The onely Argument which hee uſeth to uphold this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Rule, as hee is pleaſed to call it,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr. C. p.</hi> 246.</note> is <hi>that if a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synod could diſannul the formerly received Acts, of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, or a National of a Patriarchical, there muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity follow a diſſolution of all Government and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity as to the whole Catholick Church, yet we profeſſe in our Creed,</hi> unam Catholicam: Which Syllogiſtically runs thus: if there bee one Catholick Church, then muſt a National Synod bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Patriarchal. But the firſt is true, the ſequel depends upon this aſſertion, that without ſuch ſubjection, there could not be one Catholick Church. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is manifeſtly untrue. For that cannot be neceſſary to the unity of the Church which may be ſinful, but ſuch may be the ſubmiſſion of a National Church, to the decrees of a Patriarchal, as our inſtances ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare.</p>
               <p>Again, he further tells us that no inferiour power can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate and reverſe the laws of a ſuperiour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, and thence we inferre that ſeeing the laws of Chriſt are evidently the laws of the moſt ſoveraign power, the decrees of patriarchical and General Councils muſt yeild to them, and conſequently, when ever they require any thing contradictory to this law, wee muſt refuſe our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; to which,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee add that Patriarchical Councils have no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all in any Nation, but by permiſſion and conſent, of Princes and other Governours thereof, and therefore ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to their permiſſion, cannot bee called a power ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to our provincial Synods.</p>
               <p>VVhat hee adds from the reſtimony of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpoſe, but much to ours; It being the very

<note place="margin">3 Propoſition.</note> and in what not, with many other things above mentioned.

But ſuch is the authority of the Church, for if there can bee any ſurety of this to a private perſon, then either from the VVord of God, the Judgment of the Church, Reaſon, or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; hee cannot pretend to it from Scripture. For of the ſenſe of this (ſay you) he muſt not judge, nor can he know that the Scripture is the VVord of God, but by the Church, and conſequently, hee cannot know from Scripture that there is any Church at all, much leſſe that it is infallible, till hee hath admitted that it is infallible.</p>

               <p n="5">5. How will he know that the Fathers are to be Judges, yea or no? and which? whether all, or ſome? And if all, what muſt hee think of thoſe which tell him they muſt not be Judges any further then they bring their evidence? Is not this enough to crack their credits with him? If ſome, what ſome? and why they more then others? and who muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine concerning them? Muſt hee hear the Church ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a general Council.

               <p n="2">2. Either he believes already that a General Council can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, and then hee hath no need of this determination, or believes it may? and then he is but where hee was, after this determination muſt he come to reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The definitive ſentence of private reaſon you reject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why may not he be allowed to judge for himſelf, in things perſpicuouſly laid down in Scripture, who muſt bee permitted to do it, touching the infallibility of a General Council, which is no where evidently revealed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Muſt he not judge alſo in what caſes ſhe is thus infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo to be eſteemed? whether when contradicting or ſeeming to contradict the voice of Scripture, or evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration? whether when determining matters of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and circumſtantials, or of faith only? whether ſhe be contradicted by men of worth, place, and eſteem, or no? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when there appeareth any thing that may argue an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful proceeding, or not? if you here acknowledge that in
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:107126:186"/>theſe and ſuch like cauſes, private reaſon muſt ſit as Umpire, then what becomes of all your objections to the contrary, uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in with ſuch ſolemnity and triumph? if not, then is he evidently left at uncertainties, when the determinations of his guide are infallible, when not, it being clear that the knowledge of many of thoſe caſes by me propounded, muſt be <hi>precognita</hi> to this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whence ſhall hee fetch his reaſon to conclude this infallibility? from Scripture? this is already exploded, from others? neither can this bee rationally ſaid, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other aſſemblies conſiſt of men, that are fallible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor can they challenge to themſelves infallible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God without his promiſe, which is not to bee found, but in holy Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Apoſtles commended them who examined their Sermons, by their conformity to the law, and the Prophets; and the men of <hi>Berea</hi> were eſteemed noble for ſearching the Scriptures, to acquaint themſelves,
<note place="margin">Acts 17.11.</note> whether thoſe things which they taught, were ſo or no; I ſuppoſe it cannot reaſonably bee denied, but that the decrees of a General Council may alſo be tryed by private men, whether they bee conform to Scripture, yea, or no; for I hope they will not ſay, that the decrees of ſuch Councils, are of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authority then the Apoſtles Sermons, which yet were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the trial of private men, by the rule of Scripture. Add to this, that the Apoſtles Doctrine was attended with a train of miracles (motives very prevalent to induce beleif) and therefore if they were commended, who even in this caſe, and after the <hi>Sanhedrims</hi> determination againſt their Doctrine, and the rejection of it by the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, did thus make ſearch into the word of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine according to their private interpretations of it; how can it be a thing blame-worthy in us, to plead for ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in reference to the decrees of General Councils?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture commands us to try all things, and hold what is good; to try the ſpirits whether they be of God or no;
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 1 John 4.1.</note> to take heed leaſt we be ſeduced; by what touchſtone I pray you muſt wee try? by Scripture? then have wee what wee ſo much contend for: by a General Council? then were not theſe

               <p>Again, why are we bid to read the Scripture? meditate in it day and night, to pray for the illumination of our mindes, the ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation, and the aſſiſtance of Gods holy ſpirit, that we may know it? is it not ſufficient to read and underſtand what our infallible judge ſaith? what need of the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, and the illumination of my minde, to know the ſenſe of Scripture, if this judge muſt give it me? and I cannot have it elſewhere? yea, why doth God promiſe, that <hi>his ſecret ſhall be with them that fear him, hee will teach them his covenant: that if wee ſearch for underſtanding as for Silver,
<note place="margin">Prov. 2.2-6.</note> and for hid treaſures, wee ſhall finde it;</hi> what need of all this ſearch by any (excepting only Biſhops, who are to bee members of a General Council) if it be ſo dangerous, to judge without them, and when they have once judged, we have infallibly the truth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That rule of faith is deſervedly ſuſpected, which will not endure the tryal, but ſuch is this which will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer men to uſe their judgements to examine it; is not that <hi>bruta fides,</hi> which requires a mans beleif, albeit he knows no reaſon for it, but evident reaſon to the contrary.

               </p>
               <p>Where 1. I premiſe that ſeparation is twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the internal communion of the Church,

               <p n="2">2. I aſſert,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> that the Church Catholick which we profeſs to beleive in the Apoſtles creed, is not an Organical Body made up of many particular churches; for were it ſo, none could be members of the church Catholick, who were not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſome particular church; and conſequently, ſhould a Chriſtian living alone among Pagans, in ſome country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Chriſtendome, convert ſome of them to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, they would not bee members of the church, becauſe not united to ſome Organical part of it.

               <p n="2">2. In the daies of <hi>Elijah,</hi> there would have been no Church, there being no ſuch organical body. And</p>

               <p>Now hence it follows, that the unity of the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, cannot be external, (which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> every where ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Chil. p.</hi> 271 <hi>ſect.</hi> 50.</note> and conſequently, that either the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which is thus divided from all other Chriſtians, is no part of the Catholick Church, or which is more uncharitable, that all the Churches of Chriſtendome beſides her, muſt bee excluded from being parts of the Church Catholick, as being divided in external communion from the <hi>Roman,</hi> yea, when the Weſtern and Eaſtern Churches refuſed communion with each other, one of them preſently muſt bee excluded from the Catholick Church.

<q>Is it poſſible that any Chriſtian heart can believe, that not one amongſt all the Apoſtles (who were men very good, and deſirous to direct us in the ſureſt way to Heaven, inſtructed by the Spirit of God, in all neceſſary points of Faith, and therefore certainly not ignorant of this moſt neceſſary point of Faith) ſhould <hi>ad rei memoriam,</hi> write this neceſſary doctrine plainly ſo much as once? certainly in all reaſon they had provided much better for the good of Chriſtians, if they had wrote this, though they had writ nothing elſe. Meethinks the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:107126:189"/>undertaking to write the Goſpel of Chriſt, could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have omitted any one of them, eſpecially this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point of faith, had they known it neceſſary, (St. <hi>Luke</hi> eſpecially who plainly profeſſeth that his intent was to write all things neceſſary.) Meethinks St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> could not but have congratulated this their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to them. Meethinks inſtead of ſaying, <hi>Your faith is ſpoken of all the world over,</hi> (which he ſaith alſo of the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi>) he could not have failed to have told them once at leaſt in plain terms that their faith was the Rule for all the world for ever, but then ſure he would not have put them in fear of an impoſſibility, as hee doth, chap. 11. That they alſo, nay the whole Church of the <hi>Gentiles if they did not look to their ſtanding, might fall away to infidelity,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> ahd done. Meethinks in all his other Epiſtles or at leaſt in one of them, hee could not have failed to have given the world this direction, had hee known it to have been true, that <hi>all men were to bee guided by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and none to ſeparate from it under pain of damnation.</hi> Meethinks, writing ſo often of Hereticks, and Anti-Chriſt, he ſhould have given the world this, (as you pretend) onely ſure preſervative from them? How was it poſſible that St. <hi>Peter</hi> writing two Catholick Epiſtles mentioning his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, writing to preſerve Chriſtians in the faith, ſhould in neither of them commend them to the guidance of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſucceſſours the Biſhops of <hi>Rome?</hi> How was it poſſible that St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude,</hi> in their Catholick Epiſtles ſhould not give this Catholick direction? Meethinks St. <hi>John</hi> inſtead of ſaying, <hi>hee that believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi> (the force of which direction, your gloſſes do quite enervate and make unavailable to diſcern who are the Sons of God,) ſhould have ſaid, <hi>he that adheres to the Doctrine of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and lives according to it, hee is a good Chriſtian, and by this mark you ſhall know him.</hi> What man not quite out of his wits, if hee conſider as hee ſhould, the pretended neceſſity of this doctrine to ſalvation ordinarily, can poſſibly force himſelf to conceive, that all theſe good and holy men, ſo deſirous of mens ſalvation ſhould be ſo deeply and affectedly ſilent in this matter, as that not
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:107126:189"/>one of them ſhould ſay it plainly ſo much as once, but leave it to bee collected from uncertain principles, by many more uncertain conſequences.</q>

               <p n="2">2. When the Church in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his daies, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Arrianiſm; the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the daies of the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> with Idolatry, was it not lawful for particular Churches, and particular Tribes, to purge themſelves from thoſe corruptions?</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He tells us, that we <hi>cannot produce one example, either of States or Princes, that ever made any laws, to repeal any doctrines declared,</hi> or diſciplines eſtabliſhed in the Church.</p>

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>You ſay that the Purgations conceded and executed by Princes truly Catholick, were to extirpate all Innovations in Doctrine, all tranſgreſſions of diſcipline, that ſwerved from the decrees and ordinations of the Church, and no other.</hi>

No, in ſuch caſes you muſt ſuffer my people to periſh in their Idolatry? if they all cry out to <hi>Aaron</hi> for a Calf, and hee ſatisfie their deſires in making one, theſe Calves muſt be continued by our <hi>Moſes,</hi> or chief Governours, unleſs God extraordinarily command the breaking of them: This I am confident, would have been new Divinity to King <hi>David.</hi> Could ever the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> after <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> have reformed, without reforming all the Prieſts, who were manifeſt Idolaters? or at leaſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of Gods law; and therefore can it bee avoided by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> but that they ought to have ſuffered the people in the waies of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin? might not the High Prieſt be guilty of Idolatry, as well as <hi>Aaron?</hi> yea, was he not think you, in the daies of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and might not <hi>Jezabels</hi> whoredomes have been corrected notwithſtanding? were the declarations of the Church, neceſſary to legitimate ſuch a reformation? why is the church never blamed for not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring for ſuch a reformation? why not the Prieſts, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the High Prieſts? but conſtantly it is charged, as the Princes fault, that the High places were not removed: 'Tis true, the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath it, and when they do ſo, even the King ſhould ſeek it at their mouths, asking their advice in matters of ſuch great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, but if they turn Idol ſhepherds, cauſing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to erre, if both Prieſt and Prophet bee prophane, then muſt he be ſo far from making their verdict his Standard in his reformation, as to reform them before, and above others; and indeed had it been otherwiſe, Idolatry muſt have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced Orthodox, and paſſed uncontroled in the Church of <hi>Judah,</hi> when ever it had pleaſed the greateſt part of the Prieſts to have it ſo.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is very unreaſonable, for ſeeing it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the <hi>Church can propoſe no other doctrines to be beleiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr. C. p.</hi> 235.</note> then ſuch as either are expreſly, or at leaſt in their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate neceſſary principles, contained in divine Revelation;</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that what doctrines they propoſe to us to be beleived, they muſt bee propoſed as ſuch, and our aſſent muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to them as ſuch, and ſuch an aſſent, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires of us, to all the particulars diſputed in this Book. Now ſeeing to aſſent to them as ſuch, without evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they are ſo, is evidently to lye, and ſay the Lord ſaith, when hee hath not ſaid it; is it not ſufficient for us to anſwer the Arguments that are brought to conclude them Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations, ſeeing by ſo doing, we evince that to bee rquired to aſſent to them, is to bee required to lye; and therefore, ſeeing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires this aſſent to them, as a condition of her communion, ſhee muſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that ſhee hath reaſon ſo to do, or elſe acknowledge her condition is unjuſt, as being the profeſſion of a lye.</p>
               <p>We are told indeed, that you <hi>were in poſſeſſion of thoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, or moſt of them for above a thouſand years;</hi> but to this Mr. <hi>Dally</hi> returns this ſatisfactory anſwer; <hi>In civilibus cauſis, ubi jus</hi> poſſeſſionis <hi>valet, qui poſſidet, pulſatur, &amp; loco, quem tenet, cedere compellitur, in noſtro hoc negotio planè contra res ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:107126:202"/>Qui ſe</hi> poſſeſſores <hi>eſſe affirmant, ii nos petunt, id a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt, id urgent, ac contendunt, ut nos ſuam illam, quam jactunt</hi> poſſeſſionem, <hi>ſecum adeamus: poſtulant enim a nobis, ut ſecum eadem de religione ſentiamus; hancque ſuam a majoribus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptam de religione ſententiam</hi> poſſeſſionem <hi>ſuam appellant.

               <p>You go on and ſay, <hi>that the Pope hath enjoyed an Authority and ſupremacy of Juriſdiction, a longer time than any ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Princes can pretend to; a juriſdiction acknowledged as of divine right, and as ſuch ſubmitted to by all our Anceſtors, not only as</hi> Engliſhmen, <hi>but as neighbours of the whole Weſtern Patriarchate, yea, of the univerſal Church, and this as far as any records can be produced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 1. Seeing Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath ſo largely conſidered this pretence, and ſo abundantly proved, that in the Notion wherein Mr. <hi>C.</hi> maintains this ſupremacy, <hi>viz.</hi> from divine right, it hath not ſo much as the feebleſt plea of poſſeſſion in this Nation, nor ever appears to have had; is it not a wonder that notwithſtanding all that hee hath ſaid to the contrary, <hi>ſect.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. of his fourth <hi>chap.</hi> this poſſeſſion ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted without the leaſt ground of proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This might have been urged at the beginning of the reformation, but now his Majeſty and his Biſhops are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and therefore by your own grounds, are not bound to produce their evidences, but you who ſeek to diſpoſſeſs them; if you ſay with <hi>S.

                        <hi>p.</hi> 50.</note> againſt which no preſcription pleads, hee onely can pretend poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of any thing, who can ſtand upon it, that hee hath had it nearer Chriſts time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee <hi>Anſw.</hi> Be it ſo, yet muſt their title ſtand good, till you can evidence that you have had it nearer Chriſts time then they, which you will never be able to do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Seeing this title is held by divine right, and no other pleadable, is it not evidence ſufficient againſt this plea, to
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:107126:203"/>ſhew that there is no ſuch right for it to build on, which is done by anſwering the Arguments that plead for it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it had been our parts to oppoſe,
<q>wee doubt not to prove it a poſſeſſion <hi>malae fidei,</hi>

                        <hi>Sch. diſ. p.</hi> 29.</note> by the equality of power given by Chriſt to the Apoſtles, by the unreaſonableneſs that thoſe other Apoſtles, which ſurvived St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhould be ſubjected to his ſucceſſors, Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet they muſt have been, if the univerſal paſtorſhip were derived to them by tenure of that ſucceſſion, and by the many ages, before the power or title of univerſal Paſtor was aſſumed, and wherein it was diſclaimed as Anti-chriſtian.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, When the diſpute is, whether our ſeparation from your Church, be the ſin of Schiſm, herein 'tis impoſſible that we ſhould be any other than defendants, or you any other than opponents; for when you accuſe us of Schiſm, ſurely you are bound to prove or make this accuſation good, and 'tis ſufficient for us to anſwer all that you bring againſt us.</p>
               <p>Your ſeventh <hi>ſect.</hi> is the ſtrangeſt inconſequence imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, put it into Syllogiſm and it runs thus, if Proteſtants acknowledge that the Church of God is in all fundamentals infallible (that is, that ſome members of thoſe that profeſs the Chriſtian faith, ſhall bee kept in all truth neceſſary to ſalvation) then muſt the proofs that <hi>Romaniſts</hi> bring againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though in themſelves but probable, be demonſtrations, but the firſt is ſo, <hi>ergo,</hi> which is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then this, if the Moon be made of <hi>Green Cheeſe,</hi> then is the <hi>Roman</hi> Church infallible, but the Moon, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> if wee acknowledge it unlawful for particular Churches to diſſent from the Catholick, without an evident demonſtration (that is, ſuch conviction as a matter of this nature can well bear) then can nothing but evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations againſt theſe doctrines (held by the fourth part of Gods Church, and denied by all the world beſides) be ſo much as probabilities, but the firſt is ſo. What credit your cauſe can receive from ſuch Arguments as theſe, I ſhall not envy you.</p>
               <p>We are at laſt arrived at thoſe conditions which Mr.

                  <hi>C.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to obſerve in our Reply.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is this, <hi>to declare expreſly, that in all the points</hi> handled in this Book, <hi>we are demonſtratively certain, that they
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:107126:203"/>are errours and novelties introduced ſince the four first general Councils,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>without this certainty, according to the Arch-Biſhop, it is unlawful for Proteſtants to Queſtion or cenſure ſuch former Doctrines of the Church.</hi> Which reaſon will then be valid, when it is proved that the doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were the doctrines of the whole Church of God (for of that only, as we have evidenced, the Arch-Biſhop ſpeaks) &amp; not till then. 2. It doth not lye upon us to ſhew that the doctrines impoſed upon us as Articles of faith, are novelties and errours, but only to evince that there is nothing in Scripture or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, whence it can be made evident, that they are Articles of faith, traditions received from the Apoſtles; for this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it neceſſary for us to refuſe thoſe conditions of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which require us to beleive they are ſuch.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are ſufficiently convinced, that your veneration of Images is a novelty, that your prayer in an unknown tongue, the infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, and that nothing in this or any other Book, ſaid to the contrary, is convictive.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> He requires us to demonſtrate theſe main grounds of our ſeparation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the univerſal Church, repreſented in a General Council,</hi> may in points of doctrine not fundamental, ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead the Church by errours, that a particular Church, &amp;c. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſuch errours, may be obliged to ſeparate externally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſo far from being a main ground of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that it is no ground at all, neither doth it concern us in the leaſt to engage in this diſpute, ſeeing no lawful General Council hath determined one <hi>Iota</hi> contrary to us.</p>
               <p>That which he calls the ſecond ground of our ſeparation, hath been conſidered already.</p>
               <p>Our third ground of ſeparation muſt be this,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> 
                  <hi>that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, in oppoſition to the univerſal, can judge what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are fundamental, what not, in reference to all Perſons, States, or Communities, and then he requires, that a catalogue of ſuch doctrines be given by the reſpondent, or elſe demonſtrative reaſon be alledged, why ſuch an one is not neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I binde my ſelf to do, when it can be proved that we ever defined any thing to bee fundamental, againſt
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:107126:204"/>the univerſal Church, or are concerned to do ſo; yea, could it be that the univerſal Church of God ſhould practiſe any thing contrary to us (which yet is a contradiction, ſeeing we are a part thereof) yet muſt ſhe neceſſarily judge it a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, which is thus practiſed? and as for his catalogue of fundamentals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath demonſtrated, that ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue is not neceſſary, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I promiſe to give it him, when he ſhall be able to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it neceſſary, or ſhew demonſtrative reaſons why wee do not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We urge him with as much vehemency, to give in a liſt of all ſuch traditions and definitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without which no man can tell whether or no his errour be in fundamentals, and render him uncapable of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Well,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> but if wee <hi>deny our external ſeparation from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent univerſal Church, we are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>obliged to name what other viſible member of the univerſal Church we continue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, in whoſe publick ſervice we will joyn, or can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and to whoſe Synods we ever have, or can repair.</hi>

<q>ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church by renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, not only ſeveral doctrines, but ſeveral Councils ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for General, and actually ſubmitted to, both by the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, hath thereby depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from both theſe; we muſt finde out ſome other pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed members of the Catholick Church, divided from both theſe (that is, ſome that are not manifeſtly Heretical) with whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church communicates.</q>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every line is a miſadventure, For</p>
               <p n="1">1. This paſſage ſuppoſeth that wee cannot be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with thoſe, from whom we differ in any doctrine: ſo that thoſe who hold the Pope above a General Council, the adoration of <hi>Latria</hi> due to ſome Images, the Celibacy of Prieſts to be <hi>jure divino meritum de condigno,</hi> and the like, cannot be in communion with any other part of the Chriſtian world, which all hold the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we cannot be in communion with other Churches,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:107126:204"/>unleſs we receive the ſame Councils for General, which they do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the whole Eaſtern Church embraceth any doctrine or Council as General, which wee do not, which is untrue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Reformed Churches, are manifeſtly Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. Yea,</p>
               <p n="5">5. If he would not bee manifeſtly impertinent, hee muſt infer, that to renounce any Doctrine, received by theſe Churches, or not to acknowledge any Council to be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which they do not, muſt neceſſarily bee Schiſmatical, and unchurch us, which it is impoſſible to prove, unleſs it appear that we have not ſufficient cauſe to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wee ſay, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can produce no Churches, but manifeſtly Schiſmatical or Heretical, with whom ſhe communicates.</p>

                  <q>that wee muſt either declare other <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> reformed Churches, which manifeſtly have no ſucceſſion of lawfully ordained Miniſters, enabled validly to celebrate and adminiſter Sacraments, and to bee no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical or Schiſmatical Congregations, or ſhew how wee can acquit our ſelves from Schiſm, who have authoritatively reſorted to their Synods, and to whom a General permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is given to acknowledge them true reformed, and ſufficiently Orthodox Churches.</q> Here again, are many ſuppoſitions like the former.

               <p n="2">2. In the doctrine of the Popes ſupremacy, you muſt prove theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a ſupremacy of juriſdiction above his fellow Apoſtles, and over all the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this ſupremacy was to be conferred upon his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="2">2. If you accept of this, then ſecondly I require,</p>

               <p>And thus I have run over what ever I was able to reduce into any method, and indeed what ever I thought neceſſary to be conſidered; but to fill up the vacancy of the laſt Sheet, I ſhall take notice of a few things in this part of Schiſm not yet conſidered. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 227.</note> Wee are told
<q>that few who have any liberal educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (in that great light which they have of the continued ſucceſſion, unity of Doctrine, perfect obedience, to their ſpiritual ſuperiours, pennances, and retirements from the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) can bee excuſably ignorant, of the one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholick, Apoſtolick Church, that is, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is this Church.</q> Where.</p>

               <p n="2">2. That it is not ſucceſſion of perſons, but of Doctrines, which is a mark of the true Church, nor the want of it, of a falſe,
<q>for if hee bee a true <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> that holds the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Plato,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. They are told that other Churches which you reject as Hereticks, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Eaſtern Church) have as good eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a continued ſucceſſion as you have; can this bee ſuch a demonſtrative evidence that you are onely the true Church of Chriſt as muſt leave even illiterate people unexcuſable?</p>
               <p>Again, can unity of Doctrine be ſuch an evidence to them? when,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

Add to this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is no way evident, that the authority he ſpeaks of, was any authority over the whole Church of God.</p>
            <p>To <hi>page</hi> 173. <hi>l</hi> 30. add, Nor is this ſufficiently confuted, by telling us, that one or two of the Fathers call it an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical cuſtome; ſeeing it is moſt notorious, that they very frequently afford this title to ſuch cuſtomes and traditions, as unqueſtionably were not derived from the Apoſtles: Yea, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> moſt clearly hath it, <hi>praecepta majorum Apoſtolicas traditiones quiſquis exiſtimat; every one eſteemed,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently called <hi>the precepts of their Anceſtors, Apoſtolical traditions.</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, The ſentence of the purging fire, which was to try and purifie all men, even the moſt holy, you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly rejected; whereas, upon theſe three opinions, did almoſt all the prayers of the Antients depend, and how then can you be ſaid to have retained the prayers which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients uſed, (albeit you retain ſome of their words) who have wholly rejected thoſe opinions upon which they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend? I confeſſe, there were ſome other ends, which I
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:107126:208"/>have mentioned above, of the Antients prayers, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an happy Reſurrection, the augmentation of their glory, at the union of their ſouls and bodies, the blotting out of their ſins at the day of Refreſhment, that they might finde mercy in that day; and would the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pray for them to theſe ends, and theſe alone, wee would very heartily joyn with her. But ſhee hath added new ends of her own deviſing, as the ſatisfaction of Gods juſtice, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing pardon of venial ſins, not formerly remitted, and a releaſe from a purgatorian fire, which ſhee hath kindled, and is it meet that we, who have rejected together with them, theſe prayers, as grounded upon ſuch opinions, which had confeſs'd Antiquity, to plead for them, ſhould embrace them again upon ſuch grounds as are not onely manifeſtly falſe, but alſo void of all ſhadow of Antiquity?</p>
            <p>To p. 189. l. 34. adde, nor is it ever ſaid in Scripture, that the body of Chriſt is received unworthily, but onely that the bread and cup are ſo: further were it ſaid ſo, yet will not your tranſubſtantiation follow hence, without begging the main diſpute betwixt us, <hi>viz.</hi> whether ſuch a paſſage muſt be underſtood litterally and rigidly, or according to the cuſtome of ſacramental phraſes, that is figuratively and ſpiritually.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if they that deſpiſed the Apoſtles were ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Chriſt, becauſe they were commiſſionated from him, as we have it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.5. and he that offends a weak brother, is ſaid to offend againſt Chriſt, becauſe he doth it againſt one of his members, why might not hee that participates the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental elements unworthily, be ſaid to receive Chriſts body ſo, as receiving that which repreſents and ſignifies his body, and offers to the Receivers faith, all the benefits thereof.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Albeit the Apoſtles uſed dipping, yet did not either they, or our Saviour command it, he never ſaid dip all that
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:107126:209"/>you Baptize, as he ſaid, drink ye all of this, and therefore that he and his Diſciples Baptized in Rivers; and by dipping, will no more infer that we ſhould do ſo, then that they ſay down at this Supper, or uſed a clinical geſture, will infer, that we ſhould uſe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Dipping is no eſſential part of the Sacrament, but a mode or circumſtance, and therefore variable, but the cup is an eſſential, or at leaſt integral part of the Sacrament, as is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenced by <hi>Crocius</hi> in his <hi>Antibec. p.</hi> 214, 215.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This we do in caſe of danger, otherwiſe the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires dipping. Now in ſuch caſe, the Scripture gives war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for ſuch an alteration both by example and precept, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us <hi>God will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi> Now hence to argue for a change in the inſtitution of Chriſt, when no ſuch neceſſity in the Church can be alledged, is as if the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> ſhould have urged a general permiſſion for eating the Shew-bread, becauſe <hi>David</hi> and his Servants had it to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their neceſſities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Saith hee, <hi>do we not think our ſelves obliged to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate faſting, albeit Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament after Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; We think it highly convenient, but wee dare not charge him with ſin that doth it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The time is evidently a circumſtantial, not commanded or inſtituted by Chriſt, depending upon the Paſſeover, and therefore very unfit to bee paralleled with this deprivation of the cup.</p>

                  </gap>, the Apoſtles gave commandment to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some who think the precept not temporary, ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yea, refuſe the eating of them; and to ſuch, this inſtance muſt bee impertinent; others that eat them, do it upon this account, becauſe they ſuppoſe they have good reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the precept temporary, and made onely to avoid the ſcandal which it gave unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſeeing this cannot with any reaſon be ſuppoſed of Chriſts precept, the inſtance muſt bee impertinent to them alſo. Yea, wee have many Texts of Scriptures, which ſeems to give us this liberty of
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:107126:209"/>eating any ſuch things, but there is not any thing which in the leaſt manner intimates the lawfulneſſe of with-drawing the cup from Layicks.</p>
            <p>To <hi>p.</hi> 453. l. 14. adde, Onely whereas hee ſaith, <q>that ſurely prudence, and a moſt neceſſary care of our own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by continuing in the unity of the Church, would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate to us, that ſeeing the Church is infallible as to funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, and therefore cannot miſ-lead us to our danger, there can be no ſafety but in aſſenting to all her deciſions as if they were of neceſſary faith, for onely by doing ſo, wee can bee ſure not to erre in neceſſary points, and wee ſhall be certainly free from all danger of Schiſme. <hi>p.</hi> 266. And by this means (ſay you) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is continued in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and by aſſenting to all deciſions, her members are ſure never to diſſent from thoſe that are neceſſary; whereas Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants by taking a liberty of diſcerning betwixt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and non-fundamentals at leaſt, wherein they think the Church Catholick may bee fallible, are beſides a certainty of diſ-union, expoſed to errours, even in fundamentals.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, This whole diſcourſe, (to omit divers other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers very obvious) depends upon two ſuppoſitions, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly exploded by us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Church which wee hold to bee infallible in fundamentals, is the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or at leaſt a General Council; whereas when wee aſſert the Church to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in fundamentals, we do not intend to aſſert, that any one ſociety of men is ſo, but onely thus, that whileſt the world laſts, there ſhall bee ſome men in the world, which erre not in fundamentals,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chill. p.</hi> 105.</note> or <hi>that religion ſhall never be ſo far driven out of the World, but that it ſhall alwaies have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where or other, ſome that beleive and profeſs it, in all things neceſſary to ſalvation:</hi> Thus therefore you argue, Proteſtants acknowledge that ſome Chriſtians ſhall bee infallible in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, albeit they be neither the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor a General Council, nor any other viſible Society; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought in prudence to ſubmit to the deciſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or a General Council, as being infallible in fundamentals.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You evidently ſuppoſe that ſuch a viſible Society,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:107126:210"/>infallible in fundamentals, cannot miſ-lead us to our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that by aſſenting to all its deciſions, wee are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily free from the ſin of Schiſm: Now ſeeing according to our former deductions, ſuch a viſible Society may require the profeſſion, of what I know or judge to be an errour, and ſo a lye; the practiſe of what I know to be forbidden, and ſo a ſin; you muſt ſuppoſe alſo, that to lye againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (though it be a ſin of great affinity with that, which ſhall never be forgiven) or practiſe continually a ſin (though it render the condition, which intereſts us in the covenant of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> ſincere and impartial obedience, impoſſible) not to be dangerous, and that to renounce communion with others, that cannot ſwallow ſuch conditions, cannot be the ſin of Schiſm.</p>
            <p>To <hi>p.</hi> 471. <hi>l.</hi> 19. add, And hence it appears how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly you inſult over the Dr. for ſaying,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C. p.</hi> 302.</note> 
               <hi>hee will comply with none of your defilements,</hi> when to comply with them, is not to communiate with you in other things, or to acknowledge you as Brethren, albeit you differ from us in ſomething which we eſteem a defilement in you, but to practiſe a ſin, or to aſſert a lye, to live in continual hypocriſie, and diſobedience to Gods law, 'tis a ſhame that you ſhould triumph in this trifling Sophiſm, <hi>viz. wee comply with</hi> Lutherans, <hi>and</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots, <hi>who ſurely are not without ſome little ſtains,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take notice of that anſwer, which you meet with very frequently in Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
               <q>that for our continuing in communion with them, the juſtification of it is, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not the beleif and profeſſion of thoſe errours, among the conditions of their communion, which puts a main difference betwixt them and you, becauſe wee may continue in their communion, without the profeſſion of their errours, but in yours we cannot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>page</hi> 478. <hi>l.</hi> 15. add, And whereas you tell us, <hi>chap.</hi> 20. <hi>ſect.</hi> 10. that the doctrines the Preacher treats off, and which the <hi>Trent Council defined, were conveyed to us, by the General practiſe of the Church, and were alwaies matters of faith;</hi> It is the moſt notorious untruth imaginable, is it poſſible that the <hi>Trent</hi> Councils definitions, touching the Canon of Scripture, ſhould bee a continued uninterupted Tradition
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:107126:210"/>through all ages, when the contrary is made ſo evident by Dr. <hi>Coſins,</hi> through every age of the Church, deducing the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this point? is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Image worſhip ſhould be the univerſal tradition of all ages of the Church, when (beſides the numerous citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons produced by me to the contrary) <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> held even the making of Images unprofitable, and unlawful, and aſſerted that Chriſtians were forbidden that deceitful art. <hi>Dally de Imag. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. could they have talked thus, and at the ſame time worſhip Images? could the Church of God throughout all ages, eſteem your ſervice in an unknown tongue, agreeable to Scripture, when not one Commentator upon the 14. of <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but ſpeaks apparently againſt it? when <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Charls</hi> the Great (whoſe laws, ſay you, <hi>were but the Churches faith, and Canons reduced into Imperial laws</hi>) ſo peremptorily forbid it, as contrary to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (to add no more) could that Purgatory which you derive from the Apoſtles, bee the beleif and doctrine of the Church of God, throughout all ages? When as</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Fathers of the Church, conſtantly interpret all the Scriptures you apply to Purgatory, another way, as is evidenced by Mr. <hi>Dally, de ſatiſ. Hum. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 4. When</p>
            <p>Secondly, they aſſert that there is no place for remiſſion of ſins after death, <hi>id. c.</hi> 6. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That wee ſhall remain for ever, where death findes us, <hi>c.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That no puniſhments abide the faithful after death, <hi>c.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That the Souls of the faithful, reſt and enjoy fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity preſently after death, <hi>c.</hi> 10. Yea,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When the whole Church of God did confidently affirm, that all the faithful were at reſt after death, <hi>c.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being conſidered, the defence of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council (that they made no new decrees) is as unſeemly in your mouths, as the defence of the Apoſtles (we muſt obey God rather than man) can bee in the mouths of the greateſt Rebels.</p>
